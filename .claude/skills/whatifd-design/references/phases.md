# Phased Implementation Plan

Bottom-up. Every phase has a test gate that proves the phase works before the next phase starts.

**Within a phase family, sub-phase sequencing is strict:** sub-phases must land in numeric order, and each sub-phase's gate must be green before its successor starts. Phase 1.2 cannot begin while 1.1 is open; Phase 4B cannot begin while 4A is open; Phase 9B cannot begin while 9A is open. This is the original "predecessors' gates green" rule, narrowed to its useful scope — it catches refactors that try to skip a sub-phase and prevents a contributor from racing two sub-phases of the same family in parallel where their gates overlap.

**Across phase families, dependencies are gate-based, not strictly calendar-based.** Phases 5–8 may proceed once Phase 4A (adapter protocol + conformance suite + synthetic stub adapter) is green. They do not block on Phase 4B (real Langfuse and Inspect AI adapters). Phase 9 has two modes — 9A drives the full pipeline against the stub adapter; 9B drives a smaller smoke suite against the real adapters. v0.1 ships when **both** Phase 4B and Phase 9B are green; Phase 9A alone is not the release bar.

The release rule is: **stubs prove the architecture; real adapters prove the product.** Stubs exercise every protocol, every failure path, every determinism invariant — that's a structural proof. Real adapters validate that Langfuse trace shapes and Inspect AI scorer outputs survive the contract boundary — that's the adapter proof. Both must hold before v0.1.0.

## Phase ordering rationale

The build order is shaped by the closing principle: **walkthroughs come before code, schema freeze comes before implementation depth, the conceptual model document distills from the walkthroughs.**

```
Phase 0:  Walkthroughs and conceptual model     (paper artifacts; pressure-test the design)
Phase 1:  Type model                            (the foundation; everything imports from here)
Phase 2:  Decision pipeline                     (floor + policy; the trust core)
Phase 3:  Cache subsystem                       (scorer cache with lock + disclosure)
Phase 4A: Adapter protocols + conformance + stub (unblocks Phases 5–8 and 9A)
Phase 5:  Serialization and schema              (ReportV01, JSON Schema, redaction)
Phase 6:  Replay pipeline                       (the streaming generator; runner contract)
Phase 7:  Rendering                             (Markdown 3-format system)
Phase 8:  CLI and config                        (Pydantic config, exit codes, environment)
Phase 9A: Stub end-to-end                       (architectural proof against stub adapter)
Phase 4B: Real adapters                         (Langfuse trace source; Inspect AI scorer)
Phase 9B: Real-adapter smoke                    (product proof; small suite over real SDKs)
Phase 10: Release packaging                     (docs, examples, PyPI publication)
```

**On the non-monotonic numbering (4A → 5 → … → 9A → 4B → 9B):** the list is build-order, not numeric-order. Phase 4 and Phase 9 each split into a structural half (4A/9A) that lands early to unblock other work, and a real-adapter half (4B/9B) that lands later because it depends on the structural half plus external SDK integration. The numbers stay tied to "which phase concept" (adapters / integration); the letters carry the build-order. Reading top-to-bottom is the correct execution sequence.

**Cascade-catalog check at 4B and 9B closure:** when either Phase 4B or Phase 9B is formally gated as complete, do a sweep of `references/cascade-catalog.md` for any entries whose Status was "open pending real adapter" or "open pending integration smoke" — splitting these phases changes the granularity at which downstream cascades resolve, and an entry that previously read "blocked on Phase 4" may now be load-bearing on 4B specifically (or already satisfied by 4A). The split itself does not auto-resolve any catalog entries; the reviewer must walk them.

## Phase 0: Walkthroughs and conceptual model (paper artifacts)

**Goal:** Pressure-test the design by writing the actual rendered output for six scenarios. The walkthroughs are the empirical reviewer.

### 0.1 — Walkthrough scenarios (six rendered Markdown reports)

Write each as the actual `.md` file the engineer would see, plus an outline of the underlying JSON.

1. **Clean Ship** — failures cohort improved 14/20, baseline stable. Compact form.
2. **Don't Ship (regression)** — baseline regressed 6/20 with median Δ -0.18.
3. **Don't Ship (failure rescue gap)** — failure cohort showed no improvement; baseline stable.
4. **Inconclusive (insufficient sample)** — baseline cohort had 3 scored traces, floor requires 5.
5. **Inconclusive (cache corruption)** — `.whatif/cache/scorer/.lock` corrupted; recovery path tested.
6. **Rerun-after-fix (diff mode)** — comparing report A (before fix) to report B (after fix). Surfaces whether diff mode is in v0.1 scope.

**Expected gaps surfaced:**
- Compact-Ship form: does 30 lines including manifest reference still feel like skimming bait?
- Scenario 4 fix suggestion: does the registered template give an engineer something they can act on in 5 minutes?
- Scenario 5: does `whatif cache rebuild` exist? If not, that's a v0.1 scope addition.
- Scenario 6: does whatif have a diff mode? If not, that's a legitimate finding for the cascade catalog.

### 0.2 — Conceptual model document

Two pages plus glossary appendix. Located at `docs/concepts.md`. Distilled from the walkthroughs and the doctrine.

Structure:

1. **Product: defensible verdicts.** One paragraph anchored on "whatif's product is the verdict's defensibility."
2. **Non-claims.** Not safety certification, not proof of no regression, not benchmark, not load test.
3. **Verdict states.** Ship, Don't Ship, Inconclusive. The structural floor and what produces each.
4. **Trust floor and decision policy.** Evidence existence (floor) vs evidence quality (policy).
5. **Failure-as-data.** Operational facts (FailureRecord) vs policy conclusions (DecisionFinding).
6. **Evidence and audit bundle.** What the report contains; what the artifact bundle contains.
7. **Privacy and redaction.** Sensitive[T] discipline; profile levels.
8. **Examples of misleading outputs whatif must never produce.** Verdict Ship with 20% replay validity. Missing baseline hidden in footnote. Scorer cache disabled in CI without disclosure. Raw production traces included by default.

Glossary appendix: verdict, trust, baseline, cohort, condition, failure, finding, floor, policy, manifest, audit, defensible, actionable.

### 0.3 — Audience-distribution decision

A clarifying question for the project owner before scope is locked:

> Of the engineers you've spoken to who are interested in whatif, what fraction have a clear "failed traces I want to rescue without regressing baseline" workflow versus other shapes (A/B prompt comparison, latency optimization, evaluation-suite bootstrapping, model swap evaluation)?

Answer drives v0.1 scope:
- "Mostly failure-rescue" → ship as scoped.
- "Roughly even" → consider expanding to include `regression_check` (baseline-only, no failure cohort required); doubles addressable use cases at low design cost.
- "Don't have a sense" → ship failure-rescue only; put `regression_check` on v0.2 ROADMAP at high priority; revisit after first 5 production users.

### 0.4 — Enforcement audit

Read `references/enforcement.md`. For each "structural" claim across the codebase plan, confirm:
1. The claim appears in the table with a mechanism.
2. The mechanism is implementable with v0.1 tooling.
3. The test that proves the mechanism is in the phase plan below.

Gaps from the audit feed the cascade catalog.

### Phase 0 gate

✅ Six walkthrough Markdown files committed.
✅ Conceptual model document approved.
✅ Audience-distribution answer received from project owner.
✅ Enforcement audit complete; cascade catalog updated.
✅ Project owner confirms v0.1 scope (failure-rescue only, or expanded to regression-check).

**Cannot proceed to Phase 1 until all five gate items are green.**

## Phase 1: Type model

**Goal:** The foundation. All other phases import from here. Get the types right; everything else gets easier.

### 1.1 — Primitive types

`whatif/types/primitives.py`:
- `DecimalString` (NewType over str; format/parse helpers in `whatif/serialization/decimal.py`)
- `JsonPrimitive = str | int | float | bool | None`

### 1.2 — Sensitive[T] wrapper

`whatif/types/sensitive.py`:
- `Sensitive` generic wrapper with `__repr__`, `__str__`, `__format__`, `__reduce__` overrides
- `unwrap(reason: str)` method with audit log
- `_audit_log` module-private structlog logger
- `SensitiveSerializationError`, `UnredactedSensitiveError` exception types

### 1.3 — Operational types

`whatif/types/failure.py`:
- `FailureRecord` (frozen, slots, no `verdict_impact`)

`whatif/types/finding.py`:
- `DecisionFinding` (frozen, slots, severity enum)
- Severity vocabulary: `info | degrades_trust | blocks_ship | blocks_all`

`whatif/types/cohort.py`:
- `FloorFailure` (frozen, slots)
- `CohortResult` (frozen, slots)

### 1.4 — Verdict types and witness token

`whatif/types/verdict.py`:
- `FloorPassedProof` with `_FLOOR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` (module-private object)
- `Ship`, `DontShip`, `Inconclusive` dataclasses
- `Verdict` union type alias

### 1.5 — Policy types

`whatif/types/policy.py`:
- `TrustFloor` (frozen, slots, versioned)
- `DecisionPolicy` (frozen, slots)

### 1.6 — Manifest types

`whatif/types/manifest.py`:
- `EnvironmentFingerprint`
- `SensitiveUnwrap`
- `RunManifest`

### 1.7 — Statistical types (cardinal #10)

`whatif/types/statistical.py`:
- `TraceDelta` (internal; float arithmetic, paired)
- `TraceDeltaReportV01` (public; DecimalString numeric fields)
- `BootstrapMethodDisclosure`, `MultiplicityDisclosure`, `JudgeMethodDisclosure`, `EffectSizeDisclosure`
- `MethodologyDisclosure` (composite, required field on `ReportV01`)
- `ClusterKeySupport`, `ClusterSelection`, `ClusteringPolicy`

### Phase 1 tests

- **Unit tests:** Each type constructs correctly, frozen prevents mutation, slots prevents arbitrary attributes, equality is structural.
- **Sensitive tests:** `repr(Sensitive("password", "credential"))` returns redacted form. `f"{sensitive}"` returns redacted form. `pickle.dumps(sensitive)` raises `SensitiveSerializationError`. `unwrap()` returns value AND emits audit log entry.
- **Witness token tests:** `Ship(proof=...)` requires a `FloorPassedProof`. Direct construction `FloorPassedProof()` raises `TypeError` outside the floor module. `evaluate_floor()` is the only producer (verified by import-graph test).
- **Property test (Hypothesis):** Generate arbitrary `DecisionPolicy` configurations; confirm none can construct `Ship` without a `FloorPassedProof`.

### Phase 1 gate

✅ All unit tests green.
✅ Property test passes 1000 iterations.
✅ `python -c "import whatifd.types"` under 50ms.
✅ mypy strict passes on `whatif/types/`.
✅ Banned-import lint: nothing in `whatif/types/` imports from `whatif/internal/`, `whatif/adapters/`, or external SDKs.

## Phase 2: Decision pipeline

**Goal:** The trust core. Floor evaluation that produces `FloorPassedProof`. Policy guards that produce findings. The verdict computation.

### 2.1 — Floor evaluator

`whatif/decision/floor.py`:
- `evaluate_floor(result, floor) -> FloorPassedProof | FloorFailureSet`
- `FloorFailureSet(failures: list[FloorFailure])` for the failure case
- The `_FLOOR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` is constructed here as the only place that can produce proofs

Per-cohort evaluation. Each required cohort is checked against:
- `min_selected_per_required_cohort`
- `min_replayed_per_required_cohort`
- `min_scored_per_required_cohort`
- `min_replay_validity_ratio_per_required_cohort`

### 2.2 — Failure code registry

`whatif/decision/failure_codes.py`:
- `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY: dict[str, FailureCodeSpec]`
- Each entry: stage, default scope, required details keys

```python
FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY = {
    "cache_miss": FailureCodeSpec(
        stage="replay", scope="trace",
        required_details=["tool_name", "expected_args_hash"],
    ),
    "runner_timeout": FailureCodeSpec(
        stage="replay", scope="trace",
        required_details=["timeout_seconds"],
    ),
    # ...
}
```

### 2.3 — Finding code registry

`whatif/decision/finding_codes.py`:
- `FINDING_CODE_REGISTRY: dict[str, FindingCodeSpec]`
- Each entry: severity, message template, required details keys, derived_from_failures expectation

### 2.4 — Fix suggestion registry

`whatif/decision/fix_suggestions.py`:
- `FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY: dict[str, FixSuggestion]`
- Each entry: template string, list of suggestions

```python
FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY = {
    "min_replayed_per_required_cohort": FixSuggestion(
        template="The {cohort} cohort had {observed} replayed traces (floor requires {threshold}).",
        suggestions=[
            "Increase the cohort selection limit in whatif.config.yaml.",
            "Check tracer logs for ingestion failures.",
            "Run with --debug to see why traces were skipped.",
        ],
    ),
    # ...
}
```

### 2.5 — Guards

`whatif/decision/guards/`:
- `replay_validity_guard.py`
- `baseline_coverage_guard.py`
- `regression_threshold_guard.py`
- `improvement_threshold_guard.py`
- `ci_availability_guard.py`
- `cache_staleness_guard.py`
- `primary_endpoint_guard.py` (cardinal #10): evaluates `DecisionPolicy.primary_endpoints` against per-cohort paired bootstrap output; produces `DecisionFinding(code="primary_endpoint_failed", severity="blocks_ship")` when the cohort-level endpoint fails

Each guard is a pure function `(ExperimentResult, DecisionPolicy) -> list[DecisionFinding]`.

`whatif/decision/clustering.py`:
- `resolve_cluster_key(source: TraceSource, policy: ClusteringPolicy) -> ClusterSelection` (cardinal #10)
- Records resolved choice in `RunManifest` and `MethodologyDisclosure.bootstrap.cluster_key`
- v0.1 declares structure; cluster-bootstrap math deferred to v0.2 (uses i.i.d. bootstrap under the hood for now, with explicit disclosure)

### 2.6 — Verdict computation

Implementation lands as three sub-phases (one PR each):

- **2.6a** — `whatif/decision/verdict.py::compute_verdict(cohort_results, floor, policy, *, guards=None) -> Verdict`. Single Ship-construction site; closure-captured `FloorPassedProof`; default guard chain composes the registered guards. (Resolved by PR #26.)
- **2.6b** — `primary_endpoint_guard` consolidation. Replaces the Phase 2.5b `failure_improvement_guard` + `baseline_regression_guard` pair with a configurable dispatcher reading `policy.primary_endpoints`; emits the existing finding codes by direction. The default guard chain shrinks from 5 to 4 guards; behavior on default policy is identical. (Resolved by PR #27.)
- **2.6c** — Real `derived_from_failures` wiring on `ci_availability_guard` (replace `_PHASE_2_6_PLACEHOLDER` with failure-record IDs threaded through projection). Per V0_1_DECISION_RECORD §6 there is no `accept_no_ci` work in 2.6c; the flag was removed in the 2026-05-05 skill-alignment pass.

Common to all three:
- Implements the guard chain pattern from `references/practices.md`
- All findings collected; verdict derived from worst severity present
- Floor-failure case returns `Inconclusive` regardless of findings

### 2.7 — Aggregation logic

`whatif/decision/aggregation.py`:
- `aggregate_cohort_systemic(failures: list[FailureRecord]) -> list[FailureRecord]`
- Implements the ≥50% rule: if same code affects ≥50% of cohort traces, emit cohort-scope record
- Trace records marked `aggregated_into: <cohort_record_id>` when folded

### Phase 2 tests

- **Unit tests:** Each guard tested in isolation with constructed `ExperimentResult` fixtures. Floor evaluator tested with edge cases (empty cohort, exactly-at-threshold, all-pass).
- **Coverage test:** Every floor rule has a registered fix suggestion. Every blocking finding code has a registered fix suggestion. CI test enumerates `FloorRule` and blocking codes; asserts each has an entry in `FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY`.
- **Property test (Hypothesis):** Generate arbitrary `DecisionPolicy` configs and `ExperimentResult` fixtures. Assert: when `evaluate_floor()` returns `FloorFailureSet`, `compute_verdict()` returns `Inconclusive` regardless of policy.
- **Property test:** Aggregation idempotent — running aggregator twice on same input yields same output.
- **Property test:** All findings appear in returned verdict's `findings` list (no early-return data loss).
- **Schema-bypass test:** Attempt to construct `Ship` with a fake `FloorPassedProof` (e.g., `Mock()`). Confirm it raises.

### Phase 2 gate

✅ All unit tests green.
✅ All property tests pass 1000 iterations.
✅ Coverage test green: every floor rule and blocking code has a fix suggestion.
✅ Aggregation rule tested against scenarios from walkthroughs.
✅ mypy strict passes on `whatif/decision/`.

## Phase 3: Cache subsystem

**Goal:** Scorer cache with disclosure-mandatory, single-writer enforcement, key versioning.

### 3.1 — Cache key construction

`whatif/cache/keying/v1.py`:
- `build_cache_key(components: CacheKeyComponents) -> str`
- Includes all required components (see `references/contracts.md`)
- `CACHE_KEY_VERSION = "v1"`
- PRs touching this directory bump version

### 3.2 — Cache storage

`whatif/cache/storage/v1.py`:
- File layout: `.whatif/cache/entries/<hash[0:2]>/<hash>.json`
- `meta.json` at cache root tracking schema version
- `CACHE_SCHEMA_VERSION = "v1"`
- PRs touching this directory bump version

### 3.3 — Cache lock

`whatif/cache/lock.py`:
- `acquire_cache_lock(path) -> CacheLock` context manager
- `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` primary
- Stale detection via lock file with PID + process_start_time + hostname
- Takeover requires both `os.kill(pid, 0)` raising `ProcessLookupError` AND `psutil.Process(pid).create_time()` mismatch
- Default `stale_after_seconds: 86400` (24h); configurable

### 3.4 — Cache policy

`whatif/cache/policy.py`:
- `CachePolicy` resolves mode from config + environment
- `CI=true` defaults to `read_write`; interactive defaults to `auto`
- Mode resolution emits a `DecisionFinding` if mode was inferred (so CI runs disclose what was used)

### 3.5 — Cache summary

`whatif/cache/summary.py`:
- `CacheSummary` typed object with all required fields
- Construction at end of run; included in `ReportV01` (required field; schema validation enforces presence)

### Phase 3 tests

- **Unit tests:** Key construction is deterministic given same components. Storage round-trip preserves data. Lock acquire/release works.
- **Lock contention test:** Two simulated processes attempt to acquire same lock. First succeeds, second fails with `CacheLockedError`.
- **Stale lock test:** Write a lock file with a dead PID; new process can take over after stale window.
- **Stale lock false-positive test:** Write a lock file with a live PID but mismatched create_time; takeover succeeds (PID was reused).
- **Lock NFS test:** Documented as unsupported; test asserts the error message names NFS as the likely cause if `EAGAIN` returned without `EWOULDBLOCK`.
- **Cache key version test:** PR touching `whatif/cache/keying/` without bumping `CACHE_KEY_VERSION` fails CI.
- **Cache schema version test:** Same for storage.
- **Disclosure test:** Constructing a `ReportV01` without a `cache_summary` field raises validation error.

### Phase 3 gate

✅ All cache unit tests green.
✅ Lock contention test green (real processes, not mocks).
✅ CI version-bump tests green.
✅ Cache summary required-field test green.
✅ Performance: 1000 cache lookups under 5s on local SSD.

## Phase 4: Adapters

**Goal:** Reference adapters for trace source (Langfuse) and scorer (Inspect AI). Each is a separate package, lazy-loaded.

Phase 4 splits into two gates: **4A** is the protocol + conformance suite + synthetic stub adapter — sufficient to unblock Phases 5–8 and Phase 9A. **4B** is the real Langfuse and Inspect AI adapters — required for Phase 9B and v0.1 release.

### Phase 4A — Protocol, conformance harness, and stub adapter

#### 4A.1 — Adapter protocols and loader

`whatif/adapters/loader.py`:
- Lazy import based on adapter ID string (`langfuse` → import `whatifd_langfuse`)
- Importing whatif core does NOT import any adapter
- Test: `python -c "import whatifd"` does not import `whatifd_langfuse` or `whatifd_inspect_ai`

#### 4A.2 — Conformance test suite

A shared conformance harness in `tests/adapters/test_conformance.py` that any concrete adapter (stub, real, or future) must pass. Exercises every protocol method, every documented failure path, every Sensitive-wrapping invariant. The harness is parameterized over adapter implementations.

#### 4A.3 — Synthetic stub adapter

`whatif/adapters/stub.py` (or equivalent in-repo location, NOT a separate package — the stub is internal scaffolding, not a shipped product):
- Implements `TraceSource` and `Scorer` protocols
- Produces realistic-shaped data driven by fixture inputs
- Used by Phases 5–8 unit tests and by Phase 9A integration

### Phase 4A tests

- **Conformance harness runs against the stub** and is green.
- **Lazy load test:** `import whatifd` does not import any adapter.
- **Sensitive wrap test (stub):** Stub-adapter outputs always wrap user content; serializer refuses stub output that has unwrapped user content.
- **Cache key components test (stub):** Stub Scorer returns all required components; missing any one fails the test.

### Phase 4A gate

✅ Conformance harness exists and runs against the stub.
✅ Lazy load test green.
✅ Stub adapter implemented and used by downstream phases.
✅ Sensitive wrapping verified through the stub.

**Phase 4A is the dependency for Phases 5–8 and 9A.** The "no phase can begin until predecessors' gates are green" rule applies to 4A, not 4B.

### Phase 4B — Real adapters

#### 4B.1 — Langfuse trace source adapter

`whatifd-langfuse/` (separate package):
- Implements `TraceSource` protocol
- Wraps user content as `Sensitive[str]` at adapter boundary
- Streams traces (generator, not list)
- Builds `RawTrace` → `TraceInput` projection
- Adapter version exposed via `adapter_metadata()`

#### 4B.2 — Inspect AI scorer adapter

`whatifd-inspect-ai/` (separate package):
- Implements `Scorer` protocol
- Builds `ScoreCase` → `JudgeResult` projection
- `cache_key_components()` returns full required component set
- Wraps judge rationale as `Sensitive[str]`
- Adapter version exposed via `adapter_metadata()`

### Phase 4B tests

- **Conformance harness runs against both real adapters** (same harness as 4A, parameterized).
- **Sensitive wrap test (real):** Real-adapter outputs always wrap user content; serializer refuses real output that has unwrapped user content.
- **Cache key components test (real):** Inspect AI adapter returns all required components; missing any one fails the test.

### Phase 4B gate

✅ Both real adapters pass the conformance harness.
✅ Sensitive wrapping verified end-to-end with both real adapters.
✅ Adapter packages publishable (separate distributions, lazy-loaded by core).

**Phase 4B is a dependency for Phase 9B and for v0.1 release. It is NOT a dependency for Phases 5–8 or 9A.**

## Phase 5: Serialization and schema

**Goal:** `ReportV01`, JSON Schema generation, redaction enforcement, deterministic output.

### 5.1 — Public report model

`whatif/report/models_v01.py`:
- `ReportV01` hand-written; includes `methodology: MethodologyDisclosure` required field per cardinal #10
- `CacheSummary` typed object
- All public types
- Pydantic v2 for JSON Schema generation
- Methodology disclosure types (`BootstrapMethodDisclosure`, `MultiplicityDisclosure`, `JudgeMethodDisclosure`, `EffectSizeDisclosure`) projected from internal statistical types

### 5.2 — Projection functions

`whatif/report/projection.py`:
- `project_to_report_v01(experiment_result: ExperimentResult) -> ReportV01`
- One projection per top-level field
- Internal types refactor; projection layer absorbs the change

### 5.3 — JSON Schema generation

`scripts/generate_schema.py`:
- Generates JSON Schema from `ReportV01` Pydantic model
- Output: `whatif/report/schema/v0.1.schema.json`
- Includes `x-deterministic` annotations on each property
- Committed to repo; CI test asserts no drift

### 5.4 — Custom JSON encoder

`whatif/serialization/encoder.py`:
- `WhatifJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder)`
- Sorted keys
- `default()` raises `UnredactedSensitiveError` on `Sensitive` instances
- Banned everywhere else via lint rule

### 5.5 — Pre-serialization graph walk

`whatif/serialization/graph_walk.py`:
- `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(obj, path="")` walks dataclasses, dicts, lists, tuples
- Raises with full path to offending field
- Called before any artifact write

### 5.6 — Decimal string handling

`whatif/serialization/decimal.py`:
- `to_decimal_string(value: float, precision: int = 3) -> DecimalString`
- `from_decimal_string(s: DecimalString) -> Decimal`
- Stable across platforms (uses `format(value, '.3f')`)

### 5.7 — Determinism infrastructure

`whatif/serialization/determinism.py`:
- `extract_deterministic_subset(report: ReportV01, schema: dict) -> dict`
- Reads `x-deterministic: true` annotations from schema
- Extracts only those fields for byte-equality testing

### Phase 5 tests

- **Schema match test:** Generated schema from `ReportV01` byte-equals committed `v0.1.schema.json`.
- **Public-internal isolation test:** No imports from `whatif/internal/` in `whatif/report/models_v01.py`.
- **Golden report test:** Six committed golden reports validate against schema.
- **Encoder rejection test:** Attempting to encode an unwrapped `Sensitive` raises typed error.
- **Graph walk test:** Object graphs containing nested `Sensitive` (in dicts, in lists, in dataclass fields) all detected.
- **Determinism test:** Same input + same seed → byte-identical deterministic subset.
- **Float platform-stability test:** `to_decimal_string(0.1 + 0.2)` produces "0.300" on Linux x86_64, macOS arm64, Windows x86_64.

### Phase 5 gate

✅ All serialization tests green.
✅ Schema match test green (zero drift).
✅ Six golden reports committed and validating.
✅ Determinism test green (same input, twice, byte-identical).
✅ Banned-import lint enforced (`json.dumps` only in `whatif/serialization/`).

## Phase 6: Replay pipeline

**Goal:** The streaming generator chain. Trace → replay → score case.

### 6.1 — Tool cache (trace-scoped)

`whatif/replay/tool_cache.py`:
- `ToolCache.from_trace(raw: RawTrace) -> ToolCache`
- Strict: cache miss raises typed `CacheMissError` which the pipeline converts to `ReplayFailure`
- Per-trace, not global

### 6.2 — Replay result types

`whatif/replay/result.py`:
- `ReplaySuccess(output: ReplayOutput)`
- `ReplayFailure(trace_id, code, message, details)`
- `ReplayResult = ReplaySuccess | ReplayFailure`

### 6.3 — Pipeline

`whatif/replay/pipeline.py`:
- Generator chain consuming `Iterator[RawTrace]`, producing `Iterator[ScoreCase | ReplayFailure]`
- Bounded concurrency via `ThreadPoolExecutor` for sync runners
- Async runners via `asyncio.gather` with semaphore
- Timeouts wrap runner execution; produce typed failures, not exceptions

### 6.4 — Runner contract surface

`whatif/contract/runner.py`:
- `TraceInput`, `ReplayConfig`, `ToolCache`, `ReplayOutput` (frozen dataclasses)
- Imported from user code via `from whatifd.contract import ...`
- No internal types leak through this module

### Phase 6 tests

- **Pipeline test:** Stub adapter + stub runner → pipeline produces expected `ScoreCase` and `ReplayFailure` instances.
- **Timeout test:** Slow runner triggers timeout; produces `ReplayFailure(code="runner_timeout")`.
- **Concurrency test:** 100 traces with bounded executor; memory bounded, no race conditions.
- **Memory test:** Pipeline run on 1000-trace stream; peak memory stays within budget.
- **Cache miss test:** Trace with missing tool output produces `ReplayFailure(code="cache_miss")`, NOT an exception.
- **Async runner test:** `AsyncRunner` protocol works end-to-end.

### Phase 6 gate

✅ All pipeline tests green.
✅ Memory budget held on 1000-trace synthetic run.
✅ Timeout test green.
✅ Both sync and async runners work via stub.

## Phase 7: Rendering

**Goal:** Three output formats (1-line, 30-line summary, full report) from the same JSON.

### 7.1 — Markdown renderer (full report)

`whatif/render/markdown.py`:
- `render_full_report(report: ReportV01) -> str`
- Five-section structure: Verdict, Stats, Replay validity, Baseline integrity, Evidence
- Plus a Methodology block (cardinal #10) rendered from `report.methodology` — bootstrap method, multiplicity stance, judge state with reliability/validity/calibration/bias booleans, effect-size policy, per-trace-inference scope, causal-claim scope
- Anchored jump links from summary section to detail
- Queries `FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY` for Inconclusive / Don't Ship verdicts

### 7.2 — Summary section

`whatif/render/summary.py`:
- `render_summary_section(report: ReportV01) -> str`
- Lines budget: ≤ 30 lines
- Compact-Ship case: just the summary, no detail section
- Test enforces line count

### 7.3 — CI status line

`whatif/render/ci_status.py`:
- `render_ci_status(report: ReportV01) -> str`
- ~80 character limit
- Verdict + headline finding
- Used in GitHub Actions check display

### 7.4 — Fix suggestion templating

`whatif/render/templates/`:
- One file per fix suggestion code
- Markdown templates with placeholder substitution
- Linted for placeholder consistency

### Phase 7 tests

- **Walkthrough match tests:** Six rendered Markdown outputs match the committed walkthrough scenarios from Phase 0.
- **Line budget test:** Summary section ≤ 30 lines for all six scenarios.
- **CI status budget test:** CI status line ≤ 80 characters for all six scenarios.
- **Fix suggestion coverage:** Every Inconclusive scenario in walkthroughs has fix-suggestion text rendered.
- **Three-format consistency test:** Same `ReportV01` produces consistent verdict across CI status, summary, and full report (no contradictions).

### Phase 7 gate

✅ All six walkthrough scenarios round-trip: ReportV01 → render → matches committed Markdown.
✅ Line/character budgets enforced.
✅ Fix suggestions present for all blocking codes in scenarios 4 and 5.
✅ Three-format consistency test green.

## Phase 8: CLI and config

**Goal:** Pydantic config validation; CLI argument parsing; exit code semantics; environment-aware defaults.

### 8.1 — Config schema

`whatif/config.py`:
- Pydantic v2 strict mode
- All sections: source, target, selection, change, scorer, decision, reporting, timeouts
- Hint generation on validation errors
- Two-affirmation logic for forensic profile

### 8.2 — CLI

`whatif/cli.py`:
- `whatif fork ...` command
- `whatif report-migrate ...` (v0.1 stub; real logic v0.2+)
- `whatif cache rebuild ...` (if surfaced by Phase 0 walkthroughs as needed)
- Exit codes: 0 (Ship), 1 (Don't Ship), 2 (Inconclusive / setup failure)
- Floor violation always produces exit 2

### 8.3 — Environment detection

`whatif/cli/environment.py`:
- Detect `CI=true`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS=true`
- Adjust defaults: cache mode, profile, determinism strictness
- Captured in manifest

### 8.4 — Exit code precedence

Resolved in `whatif/cli.py`:
- Floor violation → exit 2 (highest priority; never overridden)
- Setup/replay/scoring failure preventing verdict → exit 2
- `DontShip` verdict → exit 1
- `Ship` verdict → exit 0

### Phase 8 tests

- **Config validation tests:** Bad configs produce hints; good configs validate.
- **Two-affirmation test:** Forensic profile with config-only or CLI-only fails; both required.
- **Exit code tests:** Each verdict produces correct exit code; floor violation always 2.
- **Environment test:** Setting `CI=true` flips defaults as expected.

### Phase 8 gate

✅ All CLI tests green.
✅ Two-affirmation forensic test green.
✅ Exit code precedence test green.
✅ Hint generation produces actionable errors for top 10 misconfigurations.

## Phase 9: Integration and end-to-end

**Goal:** Full pipeline reproduces the six walkthrough scenarios. Phase 9 splits into 9A (stub end-to-end — the architectural proof) and 9B (real-adapter smoke — the product proof).

### Phase 9A — Stub end-to-end (architectural proof)

**Goal:** Drive the full pipeline against the synthetic stub adapter from Phase 4A. All six walkthrough scenarios reproduce; every failure code injects cleanly; determinism holds byte-by-byte on the deterministic subset.

#### 9A.1 — Integration test fixtures

`tests/fixtures/`:
- Synthetic stub-adapter inputs (regenerable from a fixture builder)
- Six scenario configurations (one per walkthrough)
- Expected `ReportV01` JSON for each
- Expected rendered Markdown for each

#### 9A.2 — End-to-end test suite

`tests/integration/`:
- One test per walkthrough scenario
- Run `whatif fork` against the stub adapter + fixtures
- Assert exit code, JSON output, Markdown output match expectations

#### 9A.3 — Determinism property test

`tests/integration/test_determinism.py`:
- Run same fixture twice through the stub
- Diff JSON deterministic subset
- Assert byte-equality

#### 9A.4 — Failure injection

`tests/integration/test_failures.py`:
- Inject scorer outage, runner timeout, cache corruption, malformed traces
- Assert each produces structured `FailureRecord`s, not exceptions
- Assert exit code 2 with appropriate verdict
- **Coverage requirement:** every entry in `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY` is exercised

### Phase 9A tests

- **All six scenarios pass end-to-end against the stub.**
- **Determinism test passes byte-equality.**
- **Failure injection covers every `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY` entry.**
- **Performance test:** Full pipeline on 40-trace fixture under 60s (mock judge).

### Phase 9A gate

✅ Six stub end-to-end scenarios match committed expectations.
✅ Determinism test green.
✅ Failure injection covers all `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY` entries.
✅ Performance budget met.
✅ Full enforcement audit re-run; all entries green.

### Phase 9B — Real-adapter smoke (product proof)

**Goal:** Validate that the contract boundary survives real Langfuse trace shapes and real Inspect AI scorer outputs. Smaller suite than 9A by design — the architectural invariants are 9A's job; 9B answers "does the real SDK fit?"

#### 9B.1 — Real-adapter fixtures

- Recorded Langfuse trace export (sanitized; sensitive content already wrapped)
- Inspect AI scorer in mocked or recorded mode (no live judge calls in CI)

#### 9B.2 — Smoke scenario suite

`tests/integration/test_real_adapters.py`:
- One Ship scenario (clean baseline + improvement)
- One Don't Ship scenario (regression past threshold)
- One Inconclusive scenario (floor failure)
- Each runs through the full CLI path with real adapters

### Phase 9B tests

- **Three smoke scenarios pass against real adapters.**
- **Adapter conformance harness runs against both real adapters and is green** (mirrors Phase 4B; pinned again here to catch regressions in the integration path).
- **Lazy-load assertion in CI:** real adapters are NOT imported by `import whatifd` even when installed.

### Phase 9B gate

✅ Three real-adapter smoke scenarios pass.
✅ Conformance harness green against real adapters in the integration path.
✅ Lazy-load assertion holds with real adapters installed.

**Phase 9B is a dependency for v0.1 release. Phase 9A alone is not the release bar.**

## Phase 10: Release packaging

**Goal:** v0.1 ships.

### 10.1 — Documentation

- `README.md` leading with v0.1 doctrine
- `docs/concepts.md` (from Phase 0)
- `docs/getting-started.md` with worked example
- `docs/runner-contract.md`
- `docs/schema/v0.1.md` with consumer compatibility guide
- `docs/path-z.md` describing tool doctrine

### 10.2 — Examples

- `examples/minimal-agent/` — reference SyncRunner implementation
- `examples/langchain-agent/` (stub + docs in v0.1.1)
- `examples/langgraph-agent/` (stub + docs in v0.1.1)

### 10.3 — Schema publication

- `schemas/report/v0.1.schema.json` published to public URL
- `https://whatifd.codes/schema/report/v0.1.json` returns the file

### 10.4 — PyPI publication

- `whatif` package
- `whatifd-langfuse` package
- `whatifd-inspect-ai` package
- All with stable v0.1.0 version

### 10.5 — Release verification

- Install from PyPI in clean env
- Run getting-started example
- Verify all six walkthrough scenarios reproduce
- Verify schema URL serves correct file

### Phase 10 gate

✅ All documentation reviewed and committed.
✅ PyPI install + walkthrough reproduction works.
✅ Schema URL resolves correctly.
✅ CHANGELOG complete with all decisions traced.

## Post-v0.1 trajectory

These are not phases — they are the trajectory toward v1.0. Each becomes its own phase plan when scoped.

- **v0.1.1**: LangChain and LangGraph reference adapters (stubs + docs).
- **v0.2 (M11):** Config-file mode polish, second tracer adapter (Phoenix), model swap as a `--change` kind, GitHub Action wrapper. Possible expansion to `regression_check` experiment type if audience-distribution justifies.
- **v0.3 (M12):** Live-tool replay (opt-in, allowlist), worked CI sample repo.
- **v1.0 (year 2):** The pre-merge regression gate. Conditional verdicts. Acceptance mechanism. Schema v1 with breaking changes if needed.

## Cross-cutting test discipline

These tests run on every PR, not just at phase gates:

- `mypy --strict whatif/`
- `ruff check whatif/`
- `pytest tests/unit/ tests/property/ tests/integration/`
- `python -c "import whatifd"` time budget
- Generated schema vs committed schema diff
- Banned-import lint
- Cache version-bump check (if cache directories touched)
- Schema version bump check (if `models_v01.py` touched)

## Implementation gaps still open against v0.1 (as of 2026-05-09)

These are intentional shortcuts taken during phase landings. Each is structurally documented in the code, each preserves a stable contract surface so the closure work doesn't reshape the architecture, and each has a defined closure path.

### Resolved (Phase 10.1 → 10.4 landed)

- ~~**`_run_fork_pipeline` body**~~ — **resolved** (PR #70). Dispatcher now drives factory → loader → delta_fn → run_pipeline → graph-walk → render → exit code. End-to-end CLI smoke in `tests/integration/test_cli_fork_e2e.py`.
- ~~**Pipeline `delta_fn` shortcut + `"stub"` provider literal**~~ — **resolved** (PR #70). `whatifd.cli_pipeline.build_delta_fn` threads runner + scorer through the replay kernel; the `"stub"` literal is gone, replaced by typed exception classes (`_ReplayStageError(replay_code=...)`, `_ScorerStructuralError`) projected via `isinstance` into `FailureRecord.details`.
- ~~**Cardinal-#5 graph walk not enforced**~~ — **resolved** (PR #70). `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(report)` runs in `_run_fork_pipeline` BEFORE `encode_report_v01` per the cascade-catalog "Artifact-write call-site sequencing for graph walk" entry.
- ~~**Examples + Runner-contract docs**~~ — **resolved** (PR #67). `examples/minimal-agent/`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/runner-contract.md` shipped.
- ~~**`config_hash = "0" * 64` placeholder**~~ — **resolved** (PR #70 review iteration). Now `sha256(canonical_json_bytes(cfg))` via `_compute_config_hash` helper.

### Blockers remaining for v0.1.0 release

- **README final pass.** Current Quickstart shows aspirational flags; rewrite to accurately describe what ships (CLI now works against stub adapters; real adapters wireable via env credentials + programmatic `score_fn`).
- **`docs/schema/v0.1.md` consumer compatibility guide.** Walk the `ReportV01` JSON schema's stability contract, deterministic-subset, methodology-disclosure surface.
- **Schema URL hosted at `https://whatifd.codes/schema/report/v0.1.json`.** User-driven (DNS / hosting).
- **PyPI publish.** User-driven (account / credentials). Three packages: `whatif`, `whatifd-langfuse`, `whatifd-inspect-ai`.

### Disclosed shortcuts (NOT release blockers; truthfully declared in the report)

- **Empirical-percentile CI bounds** (`src/whatifd/pipeline.py:207-215`). Uses `statistics.quantiles(..., n=20)` 5th/95th percentiles instead of stratified bootstrap. Adequate for cardinal-#2 floor-passing verdicts. `MethodologyDisclosure.bootstrap.method = "unavailable"` + `unavailable_reason` declares this truthfully. **Closure:** v0.2 stats layer.
- **Cache content-hash verification deferred** (`src/whatifd/cache/recovery.py:345`, `src/whatifd/cache/lock.py:70`). `verify` does structural checks (file presence, JSON validity, schema-version match) but no cryptographic content-hash check. NFS-safe locking limited. **Closure:** v0.2 — `CacheEntry` gains a stored content hash field.
- **Methodology placeholders** (`rendered_prompt_hash`/`rubric_hash` = `"v01-cli-placeholder-no-scorecase"`). The dispatcher doesn't have a representative `ScoreCase` at fixture-build time; explicit human-readable placeholder rather than misleading zero-bytes. **Closure:** Phase 11 widens `run_pipeline(... , scorer)` so first-trace cache-key components project into methodology. Cascade entry: *Phase 11: scorer projection through `run_pipeline`*.
- **`reproducibility_addressed=False`** in JudgeMethodDisclosure. v0.1 dispatcher doesn't yet wire the scorer cache through the pipeline (cache_summary is mode="off" with hits=0/misses=0). Methodology now truthfully reports the cache as unaddressed. **Closure:** Phase 10.5+ wires `cfg.scorer.cache_mode` through to a real `CacheSummary` projection.
- **`asyncio.run`-per-trace for async runners** (`src/whatifd/cli_pipeline.py`). One event loop per async-runner trace defeats `httpx.AsyncClient` connection reuse. Workload is I/O-bound by judge latency, not connection setup; sync runners get reuse normally. **Closure:** Phase 11 — optional shared event loop. Cascade entry: *Phase 11: shared asyncio loop for async-runner trace stream*.
- **`inspect_ai` config-loaded `score_fn`.** Phase 10.1 factory raises `AdapterFactoryError` for `cfg.scorer.adapter="inspect_ai"` because v0.1 cannot load user code from config. Operators use the programmatic `run_pipeline` API. **Closure:** Phase 11 schema extension. Cascade entry: *Phase 11: `inspect_ai` config-loaded `score_fn`*.
- **`runtime_checkable` Protocol `isinstance` caveat** (`src/whatifd/adapters/protocols.py:190, 230`). `isinstance` only checks attribute presence, not signatures. Python language limit; conformance harness covers signatures empirically + Phase 10.2 runner_loader uses `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` for sync/async classification. Informational, not deferred work.

## What completion looks like

v0.1 is complete when:

1. The six walkthrough scenarios reproduce end-to-end via CLI.
2. All ten phase gates are green.
3. The cascade catalog has no `open` items (only `resolved` or `deferred`).
4. The enforcement audit is clean: every "structural" claim has a paired mechanism with a passing test.
5. PyPI install in a clean env reproduces a Ship verdict on the minimal-agent example.
6. The README's first paragraph accurately describes what v0.1 ships, with no aspirational claims.

The deliberation has earned the right to meet reality. The phases are how that meeting happens, with structured discipline at every gate.
