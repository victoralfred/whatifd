> **whatifd's product is the verdict's defensibility.** Fork production traces, replay with a proposed change, score the diff — and ship a Ship / Don't Ship / Inconclusive verdict a reviewer can read, follow the reasoning, and either trust or know exactly which assumption to challenge.

![whatifd workflow](./what_if_archi.png)

When you change a prompt, model, or tool in an LLM system, you don't actually know whether it improves behavior — you guess, with a handful of cherry-picked traces and inconsistent evaluation. Every step in the workflow has a tool: Langfuse for traces, Inspect AI for scoring, GitHub for PRs. **The experiment doesn't.**

**whatifd** is the experiment runner. Fork production traces (failed cases plus a representative baseline), replay them with your proposed change (original tool outputs cached so side effects don't re-fire), score with the judge of your choice, and produce a Markdown + JSON verdict report you can attach to the PR. You stop shipping changes that fix one failure while silently regressing ten others. You go from *"this feels better"* to *"this improved 14/20, regressed 3 — here's exactly where, and here's the evidence I'd defend in review."*

**Stop shipping LLM changes on gut feel.**

## Install

```bash
# Core + the adapters you use (each is an optional package):
uv pip install whatifd whatifd-langfuse whatifd-inspect-ai whatifd-phoenix whatifd-datadog

# From source (uv workspace) — includes every adapter:
git clone https://github.com/victoralfred/whatifd
cd whatifd
uv sync --all-extras --dev --group workspace
```

## Quickstart (programmatic)

The library API is the load-bearing surface. The snippet below is **shape-only** — it omits `RunManifest`, `MethodologyDisclosure`, and `CacheSummary` construction plus the actual `run_pipeline(...)` call to keep the README focused. The full runnable end-to-end example lives at [`docs/getting-started.md`](./docs/getting-started.md). Minimal shape:

```python
from whatifd.adapters.stub import StubTraceSource, StubTraceSpec
from whatifd.adapters.factory import build_scorer
from whatifd.cli_pipeline import build_delta_fn
from whatifd.config import ChangeConfig, ScorerConfig
from whatifd.pipeline import run_pipeline
from whatifd.runner_loader import load_runner

# Your runner satisfies the contract Protocol — see docs/runner-contract.md
loaded_runner = load_runner("python:my_agent.replay:run")

scorer = build_scorer(ScorerConfig(adapter="stub"))  # or wire a real Inspect AI scorer

trace_source = StubTraceSource(specs=[
    StubTraceSpec(trace_id="f-1", user_message="...", original_response="...", cohort="failure"),
    # ...
])

delta_fn = build_delta_fn(
    loaded_runner=loaded_runner,
    scorer=scorer,
    change=ChangeConfig(system_prompt="new prompt"),
    replay_timeout_seconds=60.0,
)

# Construct floor / policy / runtime / methodology / cache_summary,
# then call run_pipeline → ReportV01.
# Full worked example: docs/getting-started.md.
```

## Quickstart (CLI — stub adapters, no credentials needed)

```bash
# Write a config:
cat > whatifd.config.yaml <<EOF
source:
  adapter: stub
target:
  runner: python:examples.minimal_agent.replay:run
selection:
  failure_cohort: { limit: 5 }
  baseline_cohort: { limit: 5 }
change:
  system_prompt: my new prompt
scorer:
  adapter: stub
decision: {}
reporting: {}
timeouts: {}
EOF

# Run the fork:
uv run whatifd fork --config whatifd.config.yaml

# Exit codes:
#   0 = Ship verdict
#   1 = Don't Ship verdict
#   2 = Inconclusive verdict / setup failure / floor violation
```

Real Langfuse traces require `LANGFUSE_HOST` (or `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`) + `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` + `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` in the environment. Real Inspect AI scoring is reachable from YAML via `scorer.score_fn: python:<module>:<attr>`.

## How it composes

`whatifd` doesn't replace your tracer or your eval framework — it composes them into an experiment.

- **Tracers (reads from)**: Langfuse, Arize Phoenix / OpenInference, and Datadog LLM Observability (each a small read-only adapter package). LangSmith / OpenTelemetry GenAI are candidates for future adapters.
- **Scorers (wraps)**: Inspect AI (real adapter shipped); pluggable via the scorer registry.
- **Your agent (calls back into)**: a Python callable via `python:<module>:<attr>`, **or any language** via the [`exec:` runner lane](./docs/runner-contract-exec.md) — your replay entry point as a child process speaking a small NDJSON protocol over stdio (no SDK). Both satisfy the [runner contract](./docs/runner-contract.md); validate a runner with `whatifd exec-check`.
- **Downstream of `whatifd`'s decisions**: your CI gates on the exit code — a `whatifd-fork` GitHub Action (`.github/actions/whatifd-fork/`) and a GitLab CI/CD component (`integrations/gitlab/`) wrap it with verdict comments + artifacts. Also composes with SLO platforms (Nobl9, Sloth, Honeycomb) and incident tooling.

## What `whatifd` is not

- Not a tracer (use Langfuse / Phoenix / LangSmith / OpenTelemetry GenAI).
- Not an offline eval harness (use Inspect AI / Promptfoo; whatifd wraps them).
- Not an SLO platform (use Nobl9 / Sloth / Honeycomb downstream of whatifd's decisions).
- Not an agent runtime — the runner contract is the boundary.
- Not a UI or dashboard.
- Not a substitute for production monitoring; not a benchmark suite; not a load test; not a causal estimator beyond replay association; not a judge-quality validator (see [docs/concepts.md](./docs/concepts.md)).

## Design

The full design — problem framing, prior art, runner contract, report shape, eval target, milestones, risks — lives in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md). The doctrine and cardinal rules are in [`.claude/skills/whatifd-design/SKILL.md`](./.claude/skills/whatifd-design/SKILL.md).

## Contributing

Alpha. Issues, design discussion, and pull requests welcome. The design doctrine and cardinal rules (in [`.claude/skills/whatifd-design/SKILL.md`](./.claude/skills/whatifd-design/SKILL.md)) are load-bearing — read them before proposing changes to the trust floor, schema, or verdict logic.
