# Releasing whatifd

Runbook for cutting a release. The release workflow is fully automated via PyPI Trusted Publishing — pushing a `v*.*.*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which builds all three distributions, publishes each to its own PyPI project, and creates a GitHub Release with auto-generated notes.

## One-time setup (per maintainer / per project)

### 1. Register Trusted Publishers on PyPI

For each of the three packages (`whatifd`, `whatifd-langfuse`, `whatifd-inspect-ai`), add a Trusted Publisher on PyPI. For an unpublished package, use the "Pending Publisher" form at https://pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/. For an already-published package, go to that project's `Settings → Publishing`.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Owner | `victoralfred` |
| Repository | `whatifd` |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml` |
| Environment | `pypi-whatifd` / `pypi-whatifd-langfuse` / `pypi-whatifd-inspect-ai` (match the per-job `environment.name` in `release.yml`) |

The environment name MUST match exactly. PyPI's OIDC verifier checks `repository`, `workflow`, AND `environment` claims; mismatch on any of the three rejects the publish.

### 2. (Optional) Configure GitHub environments for additional gating

If you want manual approval before each PyPI publish, create matching environments under `Repo Settings → Environments` and add required reviewers. Without this, the workflow runs end-to-end on tag push.

### 3. Schema URL hosting (load-bearing, NOT optional)

The `ReportV01.schema_uri` field stamped into every produced report is `https://whatif.codes/schema/report/v0.1.json`. Before announcing the release, deploy `src/whatifd/report/schema/v0.1.schema.json` to that URL. Any static-host works (Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages on a `gh-pages` branch, S3, etc.). A 404 here silently breaks any consumer that fetches the schema for validation — the per-release checklist below pins this as a required verification step.

## Per-release checklist

For the v0.1.0 release (or any subsequent release; substitute the version):

### 1. Pre-flight (on a release-prep branch)

- [ ] All three `pyproject.toml` versions match the target tag (root + both adapter packages)
- [ ] `Development Status` classifier is appropriate (`3 - Alpha` for v0.1.x; bump to `4 - Beta` at v0.5+)
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]` block promoted to `[0.1.0] - YYYY-MM-DD`; a fresh `[Unreleased]` header added
- [ ] CHANGELOG link footer updated (`[Unreleased]` → `[0.1.0]` plus a fresh `[Unreleased]` line)
- [ ] `uv lock` is up-to-date (`uv lock` with no diff)
- [ ] Full test suite passes: `uv run pytest tests/ packages/ -q`
- [ ] mypy + ruff clean: `uv run mypy src && uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .`
- [ ] Schema is up-to-date: `uv run python scripts/generate_schema.py` produces no diff
- [ ] PR landed on `main`
- [ ] **TestPyPI dry-run completed against a `vX.Y.Zrc1` pre-release tag** (see "Failure modes → Cleanest prevention" below). Skipping this is permitted only for hot-fix patches where the workflow itself hasn't changed since the last successful release; a release that touches `release.yml`, action versions, or environment names MUST dry-run first.

### 2. Tag and push

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The push triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Monitor at `https://github.com/victoralfred/whatifd/actions`.

### 3. Verify

After the workflow completes:

- [ ] All three packages visible at `https://pypi.org/project/whatifd/0.1.0/` (and `/whatifd-langfuse/`, `/whatifd-inspect-ai/`)
- [ ] GitHub Release created at `https://github.com/victoralfred/whatifd/releases/tag/v0.1.0` with auto-generated notes
- [ ] `pip install whatifd whatifd-langfuse whatifd-inspect-ai` in a clean venv resolves cleanly
- [ ] `whatif --help` works after install
- [ ] **Schema URL `https://whatif.codes/schema/report/v0.1.json` resolves with HTTP 200** (every report's `schema_uri` field points here; a 404 silently breaks any consumer that fetches the schema for validation). If the URL still 404s post-tag-push, deploy `src/whatifd/report/schema/v0.1.schema.json` to the static host backing `whatif.codes` BEFORE announcing the release. This is a load-bearing post-release step, not optional.

### 4. Announce

- Update `README.md` Status table if the version-roadmap claim shifts
- Open a tracking issue for the next milestone (v0.2)

## Failure modes

### Trusted Publisher rejection

> `OIDC token claim 'environment' did not match expected value`

The job's `environment.name` doesn't match what's configured on PyPI for that project. Fix one or the other so they align exactly.

### Build failure on a single package

The build job builds all three in sequence; a failure in one fails the whole tag's release. Fix and either delete + re-tag (if no PyPI uploads happened) or bump to the next patch version (if any package already uploaded — PyPI does NOT permit overwriting a published version).

### Mid-release partial upload

If `whatifd` publishes but one of the adapters fails, the resulting state is inconsistent (e.g., users can install `whatifd` but the adapters reference a now-orphaned version). The recovery is:

1. **Bump ALL three packages to the next patch** (e.g., `0.1.1` everywhere — root + both adapters). Three-way version parity is a release invariant that operator-facing docs (README version table, CHANGELOG, schema URI mapping) depend on. Skipping the root bump would orphan `whatifd 0.1.0` against `whatifd-langfuse 0.1.1` / `whatifd-inspect-ai 0.1.1`, breaking the "three packages, one version" mental model.
2. Update the adapters' `dependencies` to require `whatifd==0.1.1` (or `>=0.1.1` if you don't need to enforce parity at the dependency level).
3. Tag `v0.1.1` and re-run the workflow. The root `whatifd 0.1.1` is a fresh PyPI publish (PyPI rejects republishing the same version, so the bump is necessary even if no `whatifd` source changed). The adapters publish at `0.1.1` after `whatifd 0.1.1` succeeds.

**Cleanest prevention: TestPyPI dry-run on a pre-release tag.** Before pushing the real `v0.1.0` tag, push `v0.1.0rc1` (or any PEP 440 pre-release suffix — `a1`, `b1`, `rc1` all work) against TestPyPI first. This proves the entire publish path end-to-end without committing to a permanent PyPI version.

> **Note on workflow shape.** The TestPyPI route is intentionally **manual and ephemeral** — there's no committed `release-rc.yml` or auto-detected pre-release branch in `.github/workflows/`. Each dry-run is a temporary local edit on a throwaway branch (`release-testpypi-rc`-style), not a permanent surface that future maintainers need to keep in sync. This keeps the canonical release path single-source (`release.yml` → PyPI) while preserving the option for ad-hoc dry-runs.

Steps:
1. Configure a parallel set of TestPyPI Trusted Publishers at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/publishing/ — same owner / repo / workflow / environment-name claims; `test.pypi.org` is a separate registry from `pypi.org` so the publishers don't collide.
2. In a temporary workflow branch, point each `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish` step at TestPyPI by adding `repository-url: https://test.pypi.org/legacy/`.
3. Tag and push `v0.1.0rc1`. Verify all three packages appear at `https://test.pypi.org/project/whatifd/0.1.0rc1/` etc.
4. `pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ whatifd==0.1.0rc1 whatifd-langfuse==0.1.0rc1 whatifd-inspect-ai==0.1.0rc1` in a clean venv.
5. If everything resolves and `whatif --help` works, revert the workflow back to PyPI proper, push the real `v0.1.0` tag.

The pre-release tag remains on TestPyPI and on a GitHub Release; you can delete the GitHub Release if you want to keep the public release notes focused on the real tag.

## Supply-chain hardening

The release workflow grants `id-token: write` to three publish jobs so PyPI can verify the OIDC claim. The action that *consumes* that token, `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish`, is currently pinned to `release/v1` (PyPA's recommended floating ref). For maximum hardening on a sensitive release, pin to a full commit SHA before tagging:

1. Find the latest commit SHA for the release on https://github.com/pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish/releases.
2. Replace each `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@release/v1` line in `.github/workflows/release.yml` with `pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish@<full-40-char-sha> # v1.X.Y`.
3. Land the SHA-pin as part of the release-prep PR (or a hot-fix PR immediately before tagging).

The github-published `actions/checkout`, `actions/upload-artifact`, `actions/download-artifact`, and `astral-sh/setup-uv` are pinned to major-version tags. SHA-pinning these too is defensible but lower-priority — they don't handle the OIDC token. If a future release wants belt-and-suspenders, the same pattern applies to all four.

## Hot-fix releases

For `0.1.x` patches:

1. Branch off `main`, fix
2. Bump version in all three `pyproject.toml` files
3. Add `[0.1.x] - YYYY-MM-DD` block to CHANGELOG
4. Open + merge PR
5. Tag `v0.1.x` and push

The schema URI is stable across `v0.1.x` patches; do NOT regenerate the schema unless the bug is in the schema itself (and even then, bump to v0.2 for any breaking change).

## v0.2+ migrations

When the wire format changes (`schema_version: "v0.2"`), additional steps:

1. New schema file at `src/whatifd/report/schema/v0.2.schema.json`; old `v0.1.schema.json` kept (consumers still validate older reports against the v0.1 schema)
2. `whatif report-migrate` body wired to project v0.1 reports forward
3. Schema URL deployed at `https://whatif.codes/schema/report/v0.2.json` BEFORE the tag push (otherwise `schema_uri` resolves to a 404 in the immediate post-release window)
4. CHANGELOG `[0.2.0]` block calls out every breaking change explicitly under `### Changed (BREAKING)`
