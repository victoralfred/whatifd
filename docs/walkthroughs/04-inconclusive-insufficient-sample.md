# whatif verdict: Inconclusive

**Reason:** the baseline cohort has only 3 successfully-scored traces (floor requires 5).
There is insufficient evidence to evaluate this change against silent regression.

The failure cohort looks promising (11/15 improved), but a Ship verdict requires
a credibly-evaluated baseline.

## Suggested next steps

The baseline cohort had 8 selected traces but only 3 reached scoring. Causes:

1. **5 traces had tool-cache misses** (tool outputs not recorded in original traces).
   Fix: ensure your tracer is logging tool outputs. For Langfuse, see
   https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing-features/tool-tracing.

2. **2 traces had schema mismatches** (trace format differs from current).
   Fix: re-record traces with the current agent version, or update the adapter
   to handle the older schema.

3. **Selection limit may be too low.** Try increasing `selection.baseline_cohort.limit`
   to 20+ in `whatif.config.yaml` to give more headroom.

After addressing these, rerun the experiment.

## Replay validity

Failures: 15/15 replayed (100%), 15/15 scored (100%).
Baseline: 8 selected, 5 replayed (62.5%), 3 scored (37.5%).

Skipped traces:
- `t_b1023`, `t_b1024`, `t_b1025`, `t_b1027`, `t_b1031` — cache miss for tool `search`
- `t_b1029`, `t_b1030` — schema mismatch (missing `output_format` field)
