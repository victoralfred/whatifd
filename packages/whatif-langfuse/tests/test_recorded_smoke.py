"""Real-network smoke against a recorded Langfuse cassette.

Industry-standard CI strategy for SDK adapters: `pytest-recording`
(built on `vcrpy`) records HTTP interactions to YAML cassettes on
the first local run with credentials, and replays from cassette
in CI. Sensitive headers are filtered.

## When this test runs

| Environment | Cassette present | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Local dev with `LANGFUSE_*` env vars | Yes | Replay (uses cassette, no network) |
| Local dev with `LANGFUSE_*` env vars | No | **Records** (pytest-recording `--record-mode=once`) |
| CI without credentials | Yes | Replay (uses cassette, no network) |
| CI without credentials | No | Skip with a clear message |

## Recording cassettes

A contributor with real credentials runs:

```bash
LANGFUSE_HOST=https://cloud.langfuse.com \\
LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk-... \\
LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=sk-... \\
uv run pytest packages/whatif-langfuse/tests/test_recorded_smoke.py \\
    --record-mode=once
```

The cassette lands under `packages/whatif-langfuse/tests/cassettes/`
and gets committed. Sensitive request headers (`Authorization`,
`x-langfuse-public-key`) are filtered by the `vcr_config` fixture
below — DO NOT commit a cassette without verifying the YAML is
clean of secrets.

    The committed cassette MUST NOT carry user content from the
    recording project (cardinal #5 spirit: even if the project is
    a "test project," its prompts/responses/metadata are
    `Sensitive`). The strategy here is structural: parse the JSON
    body, walk the trace shape, and replace user-content fields
    with deterministic placeholders. The replayed test still
    exercises the protocol contract (Sensitive[str] wrapping over
    a real Trace shape) without committing the original content.

    What gets scrubbed:
    - Top-level `data[*].input` / `data[*].output` → REDACTED placeholders
    - Top-level `data[*].metadata` → `{}` (project-specific tooling state)
    - Top-level `data[*].name` → `"redacted-trace-name"` (may carry
      project-specific endpoint paths)
    - Top-level `data[*].projectId` → `"redacted-project-id"`
    - Top-level `data[*].userId` / `sessionId` / `tags` → null/empty
    - Top-level `data[*].observations` / `scores` / `htmlPath` →
      empty/redacted (carry references to project state)
    - `data[*].id` is REPLACED with `redacted-trace-NN` so the
      cassette test still asserts `RawTrace.trace_id` is non-empty
      without committing the project's actual trace ids.
