"""Cache key construction — v1.

Builds a deterministic cache key for a (scorer-configuration, score-case)
pair. The same components MUST produce the same key on every machine,
every Python interpreter, every run. A drift here is a cache-poisoning
footgun.

## What goes into the key

Per `references/contracts.md` ("The `cache_key_components()` method is
critical for determinism"), the key MUST include:

- whatif report schema version
- whatif scorer adapter version
- scorer type and package version
- judge provider
- judge model identifier
- judge model snapshot/version (if available)
- rendered judge prompt hash (NOT template hash — the actual final string)
- rubric hash
- scoring parameters
- ScoreCase serialization version
- per-case content hash (so two cases with the same scorer config get
  different keys)

## How the key is constructed

1. Serialize `CacheKeyComponents` to canonical JSON: sorted keys, no
   whitespace, ensure_ascii (no platform-dependent encoding).
2. SHA-256 the canonical bytes.
3. Prefix the hex digest with the version literal:
   `v1:<64-char hex digest>`. The prefix lets storage code split keys
   across versions without ambiguity and makes mismatches grep-able.

## Why a hash, not a structured tuple

The key is used as a filename component (storage layout puts entries at
`.whatif/cache/entries/<hash[0:2]>/<hash>.json`). A hash gives
fixed-length, filesystem-safe, low-collision keys regardless of how
long the underlying components grow. SHA-256 is overkill for collision
resistance at v0.1 scale; the property we actually need is determinism
across platforms, which SHA-256 provides via stdlib without binary
deps.

## Versioning

`CACHE_KEY_VERSION = "v1"`. PRs that change the component set, the
canonical-JSON shape, or the hashing algorithm MUST introduce a `v2`
module — never mutate `v1`. The version-bump test asserts that any
diff under `whatif/cache/keying/v1.py` triggers a constant change OR
the diff is rejected (cascade-tracked).

A `v1` key and a `v2` key MUST NOT collide; the version prefix
guarantees this even if the hashes happened to match.

## Canonical encoding lives in `whatif/serialization/`

The canonical-JSON helper this module uses (`canonical_json_bytes`)
lives in `whatif/serialization/canonical.py`. Centralizing canonical
encoding there gives:

- A single source of truth for the hash-input canonical form.
- Future-proof scope for the Phase 5 banned-import lint
  (`references/enforcement.md` row 2): all `json.dumps` calls inside
  `whatif/` already live inside `whatif/serialization/`, so the lint
  is satisfied without an allowlist.
- A clear semantic boundary: `canonical_json_bytes` is for hash
  inputs (no Sensitive[T] redaction needed); the artifact-path
  encoder (Phase 5) carries the redaction graph walk.

    Adapter authors construct one of these per (scorer-config,

    contributes to the hash; reordering fields does NOT change the key
    because canonical JSON sorts keys before serialization.

    Hash fields (`rendered_prompt_hash`, `rubric_hash`,
    `scoring_parameters_hash`, `score_case_hash`) are pre-hashed by the
    adapter so this module never sees raw judge prompts or
    user-content. That keeps the key construction free of any
    `Sensitive[T]` exposure (cardinal #5).

    `judge_model_snapshot` is `str | None` because not every provider
    exposes a snapshot/version pin; absent providers MUST pass None
    explicitly so the field's presence in the key shape is constant.
