"""Cache lock — Phase 3.3.

Single-writer enforcement on the scorer cache directory. Pairs with
Phase 3.1 keying and Phase 3.2 storage; this is the third sub-phase of
Phase 3 per the v0.1 implementation plan.

## Why a lock at all

The scorer cache lives under `.whatif/cache/`. A `whatif fork` run
writes new entries as it scores traces. If two `whatif` processes
target the same cache concurrently, partial writes can interleave and
produce corrupted entries — the cardinal #1 "failures-as-data"
boundary requires us to fail loud rather than ship a Ship verdict
backed by torn-write evidence. Single-writer enforcement is the
defensive primitive.

## How the lock works

Two layers of defense:

1. **OS-level `fcntl.flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)`** on `<cache>/.lock`.
   Reliable on Linux/macOS. Releases automatically on process death
   including SIGKILL, kernel panic, or OOM kill. The kernel does not
   leak fcntl locks across exec or process exit.
2. **Stale-lock fallback** for the case where flock thinks the lock
   is held but the recorded process is no longer the one holding it
   (e.g., a hung process the operator killed externally; a container
   restart). Lock file records `{pid, process_start_time, hostname,
   started_at}`; takeover happens when ANY of:
   - The recorded PID is no longer running (`psutil.NoSuchProcess`).
   - The recorded PID is running but its `create_time()` differs from
     the recorded `process_start_time` (PID reused).
   - The lock is older than `stale_after_seconds` (default 24h) AND
     the operator has explicitly opted into time-based takeover via
     `acquire_cache_lock(..., allow_age_takeover=True)`. Default is
     False because age alone is a weak signal — a long-running batch
     might legitimately hold a lock for days.

The double-condition (PID dead OR PID-reused) is what
`references/enforcement.md` calls "the stale-lock-false-positive
defense": if PID 12345 dies and the OS later assigns 12345 to an
unrelated process, the recorded `process_start_time` mismatches and
takeover proceeds. A naive PID-only check would refuse takeover
because the PID is "alive" — it just isn't the same process.

## TOCTOU note on stale takeover

When `flock` initially refuses, we read the recorded lock-file
content, decide it's stale, and re-attempt `flock`. Between those
steps a different process could *also* read the file and *also*
decide stale — but `flock(LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB)` is atomic, so only one
of the contenders can hold it at a time. The losing contender gets
`BlockingIOError` on its re-flock and surfaces `CacheLockedError`
naming us as the new holder; the winner proceeds to truncate and
rewrite the lock file. The window during which the on-disk file
still names the *previous* (stale) holder, while we hold the kernel
flock and are about to overwrite it, is brief and harmless: any
operator-visible inspection of `.lock` during that window resolves on
re-read after our `fsync`. No data is lost; the only observable
artifact is a momentary mismatch between the kernel-truth (us) and
the file-truth (previous holder), which is a diagnostic anomaly, not
a correctness one.

## What this module does NOT do

- **NFS-safe locking.** `fcntl.flock` semantics on NFS are
  implementation-dependent; some clients silently degrade to advisory.
  The module documents this limitation and produces a clear error
  message naming NFS as a likely cause if flock returns an unexpected
  errno; full NFS-safe locking is deferred to v0.3.
- **Cross-host coordination.** The lock is process-local on a single
  filesystem. Multi-tenant cache directories shared across hosts are
  the cascade entry "Multi-tenant cache directories" (v0.3).
- **Read locks.** v0.1 single-writer model only; readers do not need
  to coordinate because writes are atomic-via-canonical-bytes
  (Phase 3.2 already writes whole files via `path.write_bytes`).

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 (failures-as-data):** lock acquisition failure produces a
  typed `CacheLockedError` with a structured message (PID, hostname,
  started_at, recovery hints). Callers convert to a `FailureRecord`
  at the appropriate scope. This is NOT an `InvariantViolationError`
  — a held lock is a legitimate runtime data condition, not a
  programmer bug.
- **#9 (orchestration not compute):** `fcntl.flock` is the OS doing
  the work. No CPU optimization, no shared-memory tricks. The Python
  layer just records provenance.

## Internal surface (single underscore, importable for tests)

The single-underscore helpers below are part of the package's
internal surface. They have stable names so the unit-test suite can
exercise pure decision logic in isolation from filesystem state:

- `_should_takeover(content, stale_after_seconds, allow_age_takeover) -> bool`
  — pure stale-decision function tested in `TestShouldTakeover`.
- `_process_dead_or_recycled(content) -> bool` — psutil-backed
  helper; tested via monkeypatch for the `AccessDenied` branch.

External callers (outside `whatif.cache.lock`) should NOT import
these — `acquire_cache_lock` is the only public surface. Internal
imports are fine because the package's test suite is the only other
in-tree consumer, and renames will be coordinated.
