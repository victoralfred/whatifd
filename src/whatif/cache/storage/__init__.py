"""`whatif.cache.storage` — cache file layout and entry I/O.

Versioned package: the active version is `v1`. PRs that change the
on-disk file format (entry shape, directory layout, `meta.json`
schema) MUST bump to `v2` rather than mutate `v1`. Entries written by
`v1` and read by `v2` go through migration; entries written by `v2`
and read by `v1` are an error (a forward-compatibility break is a
rollback hazard the cache is not designed to absorb).

The active version is re-exported here so call sites import from
`whatif.cache.storage` (stable surface) rather than
`whatif.cache.storage.v1` (versioned).
