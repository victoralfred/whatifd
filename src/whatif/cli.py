"""`whatif` CLI entry point.

Phase 8.2 of the v0.1 implementation plan. Typer-based command
surface:

  - `whatif fork [--config PATH] [--profile {default|review|minimal|forensic}]`
    — main entrypoint. Loads config, runs two-affirmation,
    threads `TwoAffirmationProof` to the (Phase 4 / Phase 9)
    adapter pipeline. v0.1 8.2 ships the CLI SHELL — argument
    parsing, config load, two-affirmation, exit-code dispatch.
    The actual fork execution is gated on Phase 4 adapter
    integration; missing adapter → exit 2 with a clear setup
    message, NOT a silent fallback.
  - `whatif report-migrate` (Phase 8.5 stub)
  - `whatif cache rebuild|unlock|verify` (Phase 8.3 stubs)
  - `whatif diff <prev.json> <new.json>` (Phase 8.4 stub)

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Ship verdict |
| `1` | Don't Ship verdict |
| `2` | Inconclusive verdict, setup failure, floor violation, OR config error |

Floor violations ALWAYS produce exit 2 regardless of policy
(cardinal #2). Setup failures (missing config, validation
errors, missing forensic affirmation) also produce exit 2
because they prevent producing a verdict at all.

## Two-affirmation invocation point

`assert_two_affirmation` is called IMMEDIATELY after
`load_config` returns and BEFORE any forensic-path code runs.
The returned `TwoAffirmationProof` is threaded to downstream
code that consumes the redaction profile (Phase 8.5+ /
Phase 4 adapter). Cascade-catalog entry "CLI must enforce
two-affirmation before forensic-path code" tracks this.

## Why a thin CLI shell now

The downstream pipeline (replay → score → decision → render)
still has open dependencies on Phase 4 (adapters) and Phase 9
(integration). Shipping the CLI shell now gets the CLI surface,
exit-code semantics, and config-load flow in place; the missing
adapter integration surfaces as a typed exit-2 setup failure,
NOT as a runtime crash that bypasses cardinal #1.
