"""Finding code registry — Phase 2.3.

The policy-conclusion half of the two-type rule (the operational half is
`failure_codes.py`):

- `FailureRecord` is what happened — emitted by adapters and stored in
  the report's `failures` list. Stage-bound, scope-bound, raw.
- `DecisionFinding` is what it means — emitted by guards (Phase 2.5) and
  aggregation (Phase 2.7), stored in the report's `findings` list.
  Severity-bound; the verdict layer reads severities to decide
  Ship / Don't Ship / Inconclusive.

`FINDING_CODE_REGISTRY` pairs each finding code with its `severity`, a
`message_template` (Phase 7 renderer reads this to format the user-
facing string), the required `details` keys, and a
`derived_from_failures_expectation` that the factory enforces:

- `"never"` — the finding stands alone (e.g.,
  `baseline_regression_above_threshold` is computed from cohort stats,
  no underlying operational failure).
- `"sometimes"` — either is valid (no constraint).
- `"always"` — the finding wraps one or more `FailureRecord` ids
  (e.g., `cohort_systemic_failure` rolls up trace-scope failures).

Severity intentionally cannot be overridden by the factory — it defines
verdict impact and changing it per-call would break the trust-floor
discipline. New severities (or remappings) require editing the registry
itself.

Phase 2.4 (fix-suggestion registry) keys off finding codes for
`blocks_ship` and `blocks_all` severities so every blocking finding
yields actionable next steps (cardinal #8). The cross-registry coverage
test lands with Phase 2.4 — Phase 2.3 only ensures shape and validation.

    `message_template` is a Python format string with named fields that
    correspond 1:1 with `required_details`. The factory does NOT auto-
    render the message — Phase 7 (render) reads the template; the
    factory takes the caller-composed `message` so callers retain
    control of phrasing for stack traces and logs. The template's role
    here is documentation + eventual renderer source.

    `derived_from_failures_expectation` is enforced by the factory:
    `"never"` requires `derived_from_failures` to be empty; `"always"`
    requires it non-empty; `"sometimes"` is unconstrained.

    `description` is internal-only — adopters read this when adding a
    new code. User-facing text comes from Phase 2.4's fix-suggestion
    registry, not here.
