"""Fix suggestion registry — Phase 2.4, cardinal rule #8.

Cardinal rule #8: Inconclusive must be actionable. Every blocking
finding code (`blocks_ship` or `blocks_all`) in `FINDING_CODE_REGISTRY`
MUST have a corresponding entry in `FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY` so the
renderer can produce concrete next steps the user can take.

Coverage is enforced by two test invariants:
- Positive: every blocking finding code is a key in this registry.
- Negative: no `info`-severity finding code is a key (info codes
  describe observations; they need no fix).

The negative invariant follows PR #17's review feedback: the absence of
an info code in this registry is not just convention — it's structural.
A test that asserts "info codes never appear here" catches drift if a
future contributor mistakenly adds one.

Adding new fix suggestions: when a new blocking code lands in
`FINDING_CODE_REGISTRY`, the coverage test fails until a matching entry
appears here. The test is the gate; the registry is the surface.

Phase 7 (render) reads `FixSuggestion.steps` to produce the "Suggested
next steps" section seen in the walkthroughs (e.g., scenario 5 cache-
lock-unavailable). v0.1 keeps `steps` as Markdown-formatted strings; a
structured `FixStep` type with explicit command/title/body fields is a
deferred refinement.

    """One row in `FIX_SUGGESTION_REGISTRY`.

    `finding_code` is the canonical key — duplicates the dict key for
    structural redundancy (a misnamed key would be caught by the
    `finding_code == key` test invariant).

    `summary` is a one-line headline used by the renderer for the section
    title (e.g., "Could not acquire scorer cache lock"). Caller-facing,
    keep it imperative and concrete.

    `steps` are Markdown-formatted strings, ordered. Phase 7 renders them
    as a numbered list. Inline `code` fences and `whatif <subcommand>`
    references are encouraged; the renderer treats them as Markdown.

    `description` is internal-only.
