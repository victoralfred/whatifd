"""`ci_availability_guard` — required-cohort CI availability check.

Per cardinal rule #10's predeclared-cohort-endpoint doctrine, a verdict
that depends on cohort-level uncertainty cannot be defensibly rendered
when CI is unavailable on a required cohort. This guard reads
`CohortResult.ci_available` for each cohort named in
`policy.required_cohorts` and emits
`ci_unavailable_for_required_cohort` (blocks_all) when CI is missing
on any of them.

Pairs with `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY['ci_uncomputable_for_required_cohort']`:
the failure record is the operational fact (bootstrap returned
None / sample too small / zero variance); this finding is the policy
conclusion (verdict cannot ship without it).

The blocks_all severity forces Inconclusive. The companion
`DecisionPolicy.accept_no_ci` flag (v0.1 single-flag escape hatch) is
the configured opt-out — when set, the verdict layer (Phase 2.6) will
suppress this finding's blocking effect. This guard does NOT consult
`accept_no_ci`; emission is unconditional. Phase 2.6 does the
acceptance arithmetic so the manifest can record both the finding AND
the explicit acceptance.

Precondition: a cohort named in `policy.required_cohorts` exists in
`cohort_results`. Missing cohorts are the floor's
`required_cohort_present` rule, not this guard's concern.

The `derived_from_failures` field on the emitted finding is left
empty here. Phase 2.6 / projection layer threads the matching failure
record IDs in once the failure-record collection is plumbed end-to-end;
the cascade catalog tracks that wiring.
