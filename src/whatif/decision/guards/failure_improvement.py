"""`failure_improvement_guard` — cardinal #10 failure-rescue primary endpoint.

The failure cohort's role under cardinal rule #10 is "the change
should rescue at least N% of the targeted failures". This guard emits
`failure_improvement_below_threshold` (blocks_ship) when the failure
cohort improvement rate is strictly below
`policy.min_failure_improvement_ratio`.

Improvement rate = `improved_count / total_scored` where
`total_scored = improved_count + unchanged_count + regressed_count`.
If `total_scored == 0` the guard abstains — the floor's
`min_scored_per_required_cohort` rule catches that case structurally.

This is the **load-bearing primary endpoint** for cardinal #10's
failure-rescue audience: the rate-based check that drives Ship vs
DontShip on the cohort the change targets. `practical_delta_guard`
is the supplementary magnitude layer (median delta vs noise floor);
`baseline_regression_guard` is the symmetric non-regression endpoint
on the baseline cohort.

Precondition: a `failure` cohort exists with non-zero scored traces.
When missing or empty this guard emits no finding; the floor catches
the structural case via `required_cohort_present` and
`min_scored_per_required_cohort`.

The framing-cleanup that PR #23 noted is now in effect: this guard is
the rate-based primary endpoint; `practical_delta_guard` is the
supplementary magnitude layer. Read them as a pair — neither alone
provides full cardinal #10 coverage.

Note on float-vs-displayed comparison: the comparator runs on the
underlying float (`improvement_rate < threshold`); the displayed
strings (`format(rate, '.3f')`) round to 3 decimal places. At standard
policy thresholds (default 0.50) the two agree. At exotic thresholds
that fall on sub-precision boundaries (e.g., `min_failure_improvement_ratio=0.333`
with a 1/3 rate), the displayed equality may not match the float
comparison. Phase 5's `format_decimal_string` round-trip pair
(`parse(format(x)) == x`) dissolves this concern; thresholds chosen
to avoid sub-precision rounding produce the cleanest reports.
