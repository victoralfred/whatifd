"""`improvement_observation_guard` — info-severity observation.

Emits the `improvement_observed` info finding when the failure cohort's
median delta is meaningfully positive (above the practical-delta
epsilon). The finding is observational — it does NOT drive the verdict
on its own; the verdict layer reads it for the report's narrative
section ("the change improved the failure cohort").

The symmetric "regression observed on baseline" finding has a different
shape (severity blocks_ship, not info) and lands with the
baseline-regression guard in a future PR.

This guard pairs with `practical_delta_guard`: at most one of them
emits per run. When the failure cohort's median delta is above epsilon,
this guard fires; when at-or-below, the practical_delta guard fires.
That mutual exclusion isn't enforced structurally (both are pure
functions; verdict layer reads severities), but tests pin the behavior.
