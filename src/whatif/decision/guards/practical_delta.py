"""`practical_delta_guard` — cardinal #10 enforcement (blocks_ship).

Per cardinal rule #10 (statistical claims must match the design):
small statistical wins inside the practical-delta noise floor are not
shippable. A change that nudges the failure-cohort median delta by less
than `policy.practical_delta_epsilon` is "statistically observable but
practically negligible" — emit `practical_delta_below_threshold` so the
verdict layer registers a Don't Ship.

This guard reads the failure cohort only — that's where we evaluate
"the change rescued failures by enough to ship". The baseline
non-regression guard (separate, future PR) handles the symmetric check
on the baseline cohort.

Precondition: a `failure` cohort exists with a non-None `median_delta`.
When either is missing this guard emits no finding; the floor or
another guard catches the missing-cohort case. The floor's
`required_cohort_present` rule is the structural check; this guard
operates above the floor on quality.
