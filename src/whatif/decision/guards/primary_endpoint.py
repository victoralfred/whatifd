"""`primary_endpoint_guard` — cardinal #10 configurable primary endpoints.

Phase 2.6b consolidation. Replaces the hardcoded
`failure_improvement_guard` and `baseline_regression_guard` with a
single configurable guard that reads `policy.primary_endpoints` and
dispatches by direction:

- `improvement_above_threshold` (default for `failure` cohort) — emits
  `failure_improvement_below_threshold` when the cohort's improvement
  rate is strictly below `policy.min_failure_improvement_ratio`.
- `non_regression_below_threshold` (default for `baseline` cohort) —
  emits `baseline_regression_above_threshold` when the cohort's
  regression rate strictly exceeds `policy.max_baseline_regression_ratio`.

Per cardinal rule #10's predeclared-cohort-endpoint doctrine, verdicts
derive from cohort-level endpoints declared in advance via
`DecisionPolicy.primary_endpoints`. The default endpoints
(`failure: improvement_above_threshold`, `baseline: non_regression_below_threshold`)
match v0.1's failure-rescue scope; v0.2 may add more directions (e.g.,
latency-reduction) by extending the `EndpointDirection` Literal and
adding a dispatch branch here.

Multi-metric support (one primary metric per cohort today; v0.2 adds
Holm correction for multi-metric) lives in
`MethodologyDisclosure.multiplicity` per cardinal #10. v0.1 has only
one metric per cohort; the `metric` field on `PrimaryEndpoint` is
recorded in the methodology block but doesn't affect this guard's
dispatch.

The guard reuses the existing finding codes from Phase 2.3 — no new
code or fix-suggestion needed. Each emitted finding has the same
shape that the per-cohort guards used in Phase 2.5b. The renderer
sees the same surface.

**v0.1 limitation (cascade-tracked):** the finding codes
`failure_improvement_below_threshold` and
`baseline_regression_above_threshold` encode the v0.1 default cohort
identities into the code namespace. A v0.2 custom policy declaring
`PrimaryEndpoint(cohort="warmup", direction="improvement_above_threshold")`
would emit `failure_improvement_below_threshold` even though the
cohort is `"warmup"`. This is acceptable for v0.1 (failure-rescue
scope only; default cohorts are `failure` + `baseline`), but v0.2
needs direction-keyed codes (e.g. `primary_improvement_below_threshold`)
plus a `cohort` detail field. See cascade-catalog
"Direction-keyed finding codes for v0.2 multi-cohort
primary_endpoint_guard".

Boundary semantics (preserved from the hardcoded guards):
- Improvement: strict `<` so equality at the threshold meets the
  policy's "at least N%" promise.
- Regression: strict `>` so equality at the threshold meets the
  policy's "at most N%" promise.

Precondition for each endpoint: the named cohort exists with non-zero
scored traces. Missing cohorts (the floor's `required_cohort_present`
rule) and zero-scored cohorts (`min_scored_per_required_cohort`) are
the floor's structural concerns; this guard is policy-level and
abstains silently in those cases.
