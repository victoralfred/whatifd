"""`Guard` Protocol + `run_guards` chain composer.

A guard is a pure function with the shape:

    def guard(
        cohort_results: Sequence[CohortResult],
        policy: DecisionPolicy,
    ) -> list[DecisionFinding]: ...

It returns 0+ findings. The chain composer concatenates findings from
every guard in registration order so the verdict layer (Phase 2.6) sees
a single flat list. Order in the output list mirrors registration order
within each guard's findings — guards that emit multiple findings keep
them adjacent.

Guards are deliberately a Protocol, not an ABC: any callable that
matches the signature qualifies. This keeps the registration site
free of inheritance ceremony and lets new guards land as plain
functions in their own modules.

    `@runtime_checkable` enables `isinstance(g, Guard)` for diagnostic

    the runtime `isinstance` check effectively asserts only that
    `__call__` exists (i.e., `callable(x)`). The full signature

    test, not a guarantee.
