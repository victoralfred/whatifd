"""Verdict computation — Phase 2.6a.

`compute_verdict` is the single entry point that turns
`(cohort_results, floor, policy)` into a `Verdict`. It composes the
existing decision pipeline:

1. **Floor evaluation** (`evaluate_floor`) — Cardinal #2 structural
   gate. If the floor returns a `FloorFailureSet`, the verdict is
   `Inconclusive` regardless of any guard findings. The floor
   precedence is absolute.

2. **Guard chain** (`run_guards`) — Each guard in the configured
   sequence emits 0+ `DecisionFinding`s. Order matches registration;
   `run_guards` is the chain composer.

3. **Severity sorting** — Findings are partitioned by severity:
   - `blocks_all` → forces `Inconclusive` (operational catastrophes
     like cache corruption that break the run regardless of policy)
   - `blocks_ship` → produces `DontShip` when no `blocks_all` is
     present; the policy says "no Ship" but evidence existed
   - `degrades_trust` → accumulates against future quality thresholds
     (v1.0+); v0.1 collects but does not blocking-act on these
   - `info` → observational; no verdict impact, included in `findings`
     for the renderer

4. **Verdict construction**:
   - Any `blocks_all` → `Inconclusive(blocking_findings=blocks_all_findings)`
   - Else any `blocks_ship` → `DontShip(blocking_findings=blocks_ship_findings)`
   - Else → `Ship(proof=floor_passed_proof)`

Per cardinal #2, the `Ship` branch is the ONLY branch that consumes
the `FloorPassedProof`. The witness token is structurally required —
`compute_verdict` cannot construct `Ship` without one.

## v0.1 guard registration

Phase 2.6a uses the four landed guards (per cardinal #10's three-layer
structure):
- `failure_improvement_guard` (rate-based primary endpoint, blocks_ship)
- `baseline_regression_guard` (symmetric non-regression, blocks_ship)
- `practical_delta_guard` (magnitude floor, blocks_ship)
- `improvement_observation_guard` (observational info)
- `ci_availability_guard` (cohort-level CI availability, blocks_all)

`primary_endpoint_guard` is deferred to Phase 2.6b along with the
`DecisionPolicy.primary_endpoints` configurable; today's primary
endpoint is the failure-rescue rate (handled by `failure_improvement_guard`).
`cache_staleness_guard` is deferred to Phase 3.

## accept_no_ci handling — Phase 2.6c work

`DecisionPolicy.accept_no_ci` is the v0.1 single-flag escape hatch for
the case where CI is unavailable but the user wants to ship anyway
(documented small-sample experiments). Phase 2.6c will implement:
- Filter out `ci_unavailable_for_required_cohort` findings from
  `blocking_findings` when `policy.accept_no_ci=True`
- Emit a separate `info` finding noting the acceptance was used
- Both the original finding AND the acceptance are recorded in the
  manifest so the audit trail is complete

For Phase 2.6a, `accept_no_ci` is NOT consulted — the guard's emission
is unconditional. Tests pin both behaviors so Phase 2.6c can flip the
existing assertions cleanly.
