"""`whatif diff` — compare two whatif reports.

Phase 8.4 of the v0.1 implementation plan. Surfaced in walkthrough
scenario 6 (rerun-after-fix): an engineer fixes an issue an
earlier run flagged, reruns, and wants to see "did anything
change". The diff is a Markdown summary of structural deltas
between two `ReportV01` JSON files.

## Scope (v0.1)

- `verdict_state` transitions (e.g., `dont_ship` → `ship`).
- `cohort_results`: per-cohort counts (improved / unchanged /
  regressed / scored) and `median_delta`.
- `decision_findings`: added / removed codes.
- `failures`: count change.

## Deferred to v0.2

- Per-trace evidence diff (which traces newly improved /
  regressed). Requires the per-trace evidence schema that's
  cascade-tracked but not in v0.1 `ReportV01`.
- Full structural recursive diff of methodology / cache_summary
  / runtime. v0.1 surfaces verdict-relevant deltas; deeper
  structural drift is a debugging concern, not a verdict
  concern.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 failures-as-data:** read errors (file missing, parse fail)
  return typed `DiffError`; consumers branch rather than catch
  exceptions.
- **#6 typed boundaries:** the diff result is a frozen dataclass
  with typed sub-records, not a free-form dict.
- **#10 statistical claims match design:** the diff renders
  cohort numbers as deltas — it does NOT add inference (e.g.,
  "this is a regression" without the policy threshold the
  decision pipeline applied). The verdict-state transition is
  the load-bearing claim; everything else is descriptive.
