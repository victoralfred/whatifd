"""Programmatic integration entry point — Phase 9A.1.

`run_pipeline(trace_source, *, delta_fn, floor, policy, runtime,
methodology, cache_summary) -> ReportV01` stitches the adapter →
cohort aggregation → verdict → projection path end-to-end.

## Phase 9A.1 scope and shortcuts

This sub-phase establishes the architectural plumbing. Two
deliberate shortcuts that follow-up sub-phases close:

- **Per-trace deltas come from a caller-supplied `delta_fn`**, not
  from running a real `Scorer` over (original, replayed) pairs.
  The stub's faithfulness is fixture-driven and the integration
  test controls the delta function. Phase 9A.2+ wires real paired
  scoring through the stub's `Scorer` once a Runner is available
  in scope.
- **CI bounds use empirical 5th/95th percentiles of the deltas**,
  not stratified bootstrap. Adequate for cardinal-#2 floor-passing
  Ship/Don't-Ship verdicts in tests; Phase 9A.3 (determinism) +
  the broader stats layer replace this with proper bootstrap.

Both shortcuts are documented at the call sites; the function
signature is the stable contract.

## What this function does NOT do

- Read the cache. The cache subsystem is exercised by
  `whatif.cache` unit tests; integration tests pass a pre-built
  `CacheSummary`.
- Build the manifest. Manifest construction (timestamps, env
  fingerprint, sensitive-unwrap drain) is the CLI's responsibility;
  integration tests pass a pre-built `RunManifest`.
- Run a real two-affirmation. Tests construct fixtures directly;
  the CLI surface enforces cardinal #7.
