"""`render_ci_status` — one-line CI status string for a `ReportV01`.

Phase 7.3 of the v0.1 implementation plan. Produces a single line
of ≤80 visible characters suitable for a CI-check title, GitHub
status row, or Slack notification:

  ✓ whatif: Ship — failures 14/20 ↑, baseline 17/20 stable
  ✗ whatif: Don't Ship — baseline regressed 6/20 (median Δ -0.18)
  ⚠ whatif: Inconclusive — baseline cohort below floor (3 < 5 min_scored…)

The format is `<glyph> whatif: <Verdict> — <reason>` where:

- `<glyph>` is `✓` (Ship) / `✗` (Don't Ship) / `⚠` (Inconclusive).
- `<Verdict>` is the human label, NOT the wire `verdict_state`.
- `<reason>` is verdict-derived:
  - **Ship:** improved/total summary across required cohorts.
  - **Don't Ship / Inconclusive:** the highest-severity decision
    finding's message, or — if no findings — the top floor-failure
    rule. The decision pipeline guarantees that a non-Ship verdict
    has at least one finding or floor failure (cardinal #2 + #8),
    so we always have a reason; the test fixtures pin this.

## Length budget

Visible-character length ≤80. The reason is truncated with `…` if
the full string would exceed the budget. The glyph + prefix
(`✓ whatif: Ship — `) is 17-25 characters depending on verdict,
leaving 55-63 chars for the reason on most calls.

NOTE: visible-character count is `len(string)` since the format is
ASCII + the three single-codepoint glyphs in `_GLYPH` (`✓` U+2713,
`✗` U+2717, `⚠` U+26A0). We do NOT use Unicode east-asian-width
measurement; the glyphs are narrow, the ASCII text contributes one
column per char, and budget-conscious renderers (GitHub status,
terminal status bars) treat string length and visible width
identically for this content. The pin
`TestGlyphCodePointStability::test_glyphs_are_single_code_point`
fails if a future contributor adds a multi-codepoint glyph (e.g.,
an emoji built from regional-indicator pairs), forcing them to
re-evaluate this width claim.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#8 actionable Inconclusive:** the reason for an Inconclusive
  verdict surfaces a registered finding or floor rule; it is NOT a
  generic "experiment failed" string. Operators reading the CI
  status get enough to know what to fix without opening the full
  report.
- **#2 floor cannot be bypassed:** if the floor failed, the
  verdict is Inconclusive and the reason cites the floor rule.
- **#10 disclosure necessary:** the CI status is the COMPACT form;
  methodology disclosure lives in the full report. A consumer who
  trusts only the CI status sees the verdict, not the methodology
  caveats — this is by design (the compact format can't carry the
  full disclosure), and the full report is the canonical artifact.
