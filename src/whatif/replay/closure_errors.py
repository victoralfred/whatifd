"""Typed exceptions raised by `whatif.cli_pipeline.build_delta_fn`'s
closure and consumed by `whatif.pipeline.run_pipeline`'s exception
projection.

These live here (`whatif.replay`) — NOT in `whatif.cli_pipeline` —
because the CORE pipeline (`whatif.pipeline`) reads them via
`isinstance` to project structured fields into `FailureRecord.details`.
Putting them in the CLI-layer module would create a core → CLI
import inversion: every non-CLI caller of `run_pipeline` (e.g.,
programmatic consumers, integration tests) would transitively load
the CLI pipeline module on first trace failure.

The shared module is at the replay-result layer because:
- `_ReplayStageError` projects a kernel `ReplayFailure` into the
  closure surface; replay-result is its natural home.
- `_ScorerStructuralError` fits less neatly but co-locating with
  the replay error keeps pipeline.py's import path single-source.

Cardinal #1: failure classification is type-level (`isinstance`),
NOT convention-based (`getattr` on attribute names).
