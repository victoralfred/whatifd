"""`replay_one_trace` — the per-trace replay kernel.

Phase 6.3a of the v0.1 implementation plan. The kernel is the
boundary that converts the three classes of runner-execution
failure into typed `ReplayFailure` records:

  - `CacheMissError` → `ReplayFailure(code="tool_cache_miss")`
  - timeout       → `ReplayFailure(code="runner_timeout")`
  - any other     → `ReplayFailure(code="runner_exception")`

The kernel is synchronous, per-trace, and standalone. Phase 6.3b
will compose it into a streaming pipeline with `ThreadPoolExecutor`
bounded concurrency; Phase 6.3c adds the async runner path. Keeping
the kernel as a pure function lets the streaming layer choose its
own concurrency strategy without rewriting the failure-conversion
logic.

## Why a separate kernel

Cardinal #1 says expected failures are structured data. The runner
is user code — it can:
- Call `tool_cache.lookup(...)` and get a `CacheMissError`
- Hang past the configured timeout
- Raise any Python exception

Each of these is a known failure mode that must produce a
`ReplayFailure`, not propagate as an exception out of the pipeline.
The kernel catches all three at one place; downstream code (the
pipeline streaming layer, the report assembler) sees a uniform
`ReplayResult` and never has to think about exception handling.

## Why threads for timeout (and the leaked-thread caveat)

Python has no portable way to kill a running thread. The kernel
uses `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)` + `future.result(timeout=
...)`: on timeout, the future is cancelled (which only succeeds if
it hasn't started), but the underlying thread KEEPS RUNNING until
the user runner returns naturally. We accept this for v0.1:

- The runner is user-controlled code. We document the requirement
  that runners be timeout-aware (via inner I/O timeouts on HTTP
  clients, etc.) so the wall-clock limit isn't load-bearing.
- The kernel-level timeout is a backstop for runners that hang on
  e.g., an infinite loop. Such runners surface as `runner_timeout`
  in the report; the leaked thread eventually returns and is GC'd.
- A v0.2 hardening could move runners into a subprocess pool so
  termination is enforceable; not v0.1 scope.

The alternative timeout mechanisms (`signal.SIGALRM`, asyncio task
cancellation) have their own issues (main-thread-only; doesn't help
sync runners). The thread-pool approach is the least-bad default.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 failures-as-data:** all three exception classes catch and
  convert to typed `ReplayFailure`. Nothing escapes the kernel as
  an exception (a programmer bug — e.g., a `ReplayFailure`
  construction error from an unregistered code — does propagate;
  cardinal #1 covers EXPECTED failures, not whatif bugs).
- **#5 sensitive data wrapped:** the kernel never inspects the
  runner's `ReplayOutput` for sensitive content. Adapter-side
  wrapping (Phase 4) is the responsibility for that.
- **#9 orchestration not compute:** the kernel orchestrates a
  single user-runner call. No data transformation, no scoring, no
  decision logic.

    """Run the runner for one trace; return a typed result.

    The runner is invoked in a worker thread so a wall-clock timeout
    can fire. The kernel returns:

    - `ReplaySuccess(trace_id, cohort, output)` when the runner
      returns a `ReplayOutput` cleanly within the timeout.
    - `ReplayFailure(code="tool_cache_miss")` when the runner's
      `tool_cache.lookup(...)` raised `CacheMissError`.
    - `ReplayFailure(code="runner_timeout")` when the runner did
      not return within `timeout_seconds`.
    - `ReplayFailure(code="runner_exception")` for any other
      exception escaping the runner.

    The order of catches matters: `CacheMissError` is more specific
    than the bare-`Exception` catch and must come first so a cache
    miss is classified correctly even though it IS a Python
    exception.

    Re-raise guarantee: `concurrent.futures.Future.result()`
    re-raises the worker thread's exception UNWRAPPED. CPython
    `_invoke_callbacks` stores the exception object via
    `self._exception = exc`, and `result()` does
    `raise self._exception`. So `CacheMissError` raised inside the
    runner thread arrives at this `except` clause as
    `CacheMissError`, not wrapped in any "thread exception" type.
    The `test_cache_miss_produces_typed_failure` test pins this end
    to end (the assertion `result.code == "tool_cache_miss"` would
    fail under any future Python that wrapped exceptions).

    `timeout_seconds` is enforced via `concurrent.futures.Future
    .result(timeout=...)`. On timeout, the underlying thread keeps
    running until the runner completes (Python can't kill threads);
    the kernel still returns immediately with the typed failure.
    See module docstring for the leaked-thread caveat.
