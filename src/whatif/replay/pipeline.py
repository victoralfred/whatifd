"""`replay_stream` — bounded-concurrency streaming wrapper over the
kernel.

Phase 6.3b of the v0.1 implementation plan. The streaming pipeline
takes an iterable of `ReplayInputBundle` and yields `ReplayResult`
values via `replay_one_trace` (Phase 6.3a) under a sliding-window
`ThreadPoolExecutor`. Properties:

- **Bounded memory:** at most `max_workers` bundles are in flight
  at any time. The input iterable is consumed lazily — large
  batches don't load into memory.
- **Streaming yield:** results are yielded as they complete (any
  order). The caller can process them incrementally.
- **No order guarantee:** completions are in arrival order, NOT
  input order. The report aggregator (Phase 2.7 / Phase 9) sorts
  the failures and cohort_results by trace_id; the pipeline
  doesn't need to preserve order to satisfy the report contract.

## Why a sliding window, not gather-all-then-yield

A naive `[ex.submit(...) for b in bundles]` eagerly consumes the
input iterable, defeating streaming. For a 10k-trace fixture this
would queue all 10k tasks before yielding any result. The sliding
window keeps `max_workers` in flight: prime with N submits, yield
each completion, submit one more. Memory is O(max_workers), not
O(len(bundles)).

## Concurrency interaction with the kernel's per-call executor

The kernel (`replay_one_trace`) uses its OWN
`ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1)` per call for timeout
enforcement. The streaming layer's outer executor submits kernel
CALLS, not runner calls — each kernel call is a single Python
function returning a `ReplayResult`. The outer pool's worker thread
runs the kernel; the kernel internally spawns ANOTHER worker thread
for the runner. Peak threads = 2 * max_workers (one outer + one
inner per concurrent kernel).

The kernel returns synchronously even on timeout (it
`shutdown(wait=False)` the inner executor and detaches the leaked
runner thread). So the streaming layer's `shutdown(wait=True)` at
end of `with` only waits for kernel returns, NOT for leaked runner
threads. The cascade catalog entry "Per-trace ThreadPoolExecutor +
leaked-thread-on-timeout pattern" warned against an outer
`wait=True` that would serialize timeouts; this layer is safe
because the kernel's timeout return is fast (it doesn't block on
the leak).

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 failures-as-data:** the kernel is the failure-conversion
  boundary. The streaming layer just transports kernel results;
  it never raises for runner-related conditions. A bug in the
  kernel itself would propagate, which is correct (cardinal #1
  covers expected failures, not whatif-internal bugs).
- **#9 orchestration not compute:** bounded thread pool, no CPU
  optimization, no shared-memory tricks. The pool exists to
  parallelize I/O-bound runner calls (LLM API requests).

    the underlying trace stream.

    ## Sensitive-data discipline (cardinal #5)

    `trace_input.user_message` (and any `metadata` keys) carry raw
    user content from the production trace. The ADAPTER (Phase 4)
    is responsible for wrapping any sensitive fields as
    `Sensitive[T]` BEFORE constructing the bundle. The bundle
    itself does not enforce or re-wrap; it relies on the adapter
    boundary. The pre-serialization graph walk
    (`assert_no_unredacted_sensitive`, Phase 5.4) is the runtime
    safety net that catches any unwrapped `Sensitive[T]` reaching
    the artifact-write path.
