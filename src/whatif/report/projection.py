"""Projection: internal types → `ReportV01` wire format.

Phase 5.2 of the v0.1 implementation plan; pairs with Phase 5.1
(`models_v01.py` — the wire types) and the upcoming serialization
sub-phases (5.3 encoder, 5.4 graph walk, 5.5 schema gen).

## Cardinal #2 contract — verdict input must be the sealed union

`project_to_report_v01` takes a `Verdict` (the internal sealed union
`Ship | DontShip | Inconclusive`) as input — NOT a bare
`verdict_state: str`, NOT the components of a Ship. This is structural,
not stylistic:

- The only way to obtain a `Ship` instance is through `compute_verdict`
  / `evaluate_floor`, which produce and consume `FloorPassedProof`.
- The witness-token closure-capture in `whatif/decision/floor.py`
  prevents external construction of `FloorPassedProof`, and `Ship`
  requires one.
- Therefore: if the caller has a `Verdict` to pass in, the floor was
  verified at the appropriate point upstream.

A `project_to_report_v01(verdict_state: str, ...)` shape would re-open
the cardinal #2 bypass — a caller could synthesize `verdict_state="ship"`
without ever touching the witness machinery. The `Verdict` input is the
type-level chokepoint that closes that bypass.

## What this module flattens

The internal `Verdict` carries verdict-specific data on each variant
(Ship has `findings`; DontShip has `findings + blocking_findings`;
Inconclusive has those plus `floor_failures`). The wire format is
flat: a single `decision_findings` list and the `verdict_state`
literal. Projection takes a Verdict in, takes other typed inputs
(failures, cache_summary, methodology, runtime), and returns a
fully-populated `ReportV01`.

## What this module does NOT do

- **Bootstrap CI / stats.** Cohort-level CI is computed upstream; the
  `cohort_results` carrying CI live on the Verdict already.
- **Methodology assembly.** The caller builds `MethodologyDisclosure`
  from configured policy + observed run state and passes it in.
- **Sensitive-data redaction.** Phase 5.4's
  `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive` is the structural defense before
  the `WhatifJSONEncoder` (5.3) sees the report. Projection is just
  field-copying; it does not unwrap `Sensitive[T]`.
- **Schema generation.** Phase 5.5 produces the JSON Schema artifact
  from the `ReportV01` type signature; projection consumes the type,
  not the schema.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 (failures-as-data):** `failures` is required, accepts an empty
  sequence (clean run). `decision_findings` is derived from the
  Verdict's typed findings list, not parsed from strings.
- **#2 (floor cannot be bypassed):** `Verdict` input is the
  type-level enforcement — see preamble.
- **#6 (typed boundaries):** all inputs are typed; the function
  returns a `ReportV01` with no `dict[str, Any]` boundary anywhere.
- **#10 (statistical claims match design):** `methodology:
  MethodologyDisclosure` is required.

    The single load-bearing constraint is the `verdict: Verdict`
    parameter — see module docstring for the cardinal #2 rationale.
    Once that's satisfied, the rest is field-copying.

    Inputs:

    - `verdict`: the resolved internal `Verdict`. Carries
      `cohort_results` and `findings` on each variant; projection
      reads them and flattens into the wire-format siblings.
    - `failures`: run-level operational failures. Empty on clean
      runs; non-empty when (e.g.) trace ingestion or scoring
      surfaced typed `FailureRecord` data per cardinal #1.
    - `cache_summary`: required `CacheSummary` from Phase 3.5.
    - `methodology`: required `MethodologyDisclosure` per cardinal
      #10. The caller builds this from policy + observed run state.
    - `runtime`: the `RunManifest` carrying timestamps, config hash,
      trust floor, decision policy, environment fingerprint, and
      sensitive-unwrap audit log. Stamped into `ReportV01.runtime`
      (the only non-deterministic field) and additionally provides
      `trust_floor` / `decision_policy` for the report's top-level
      typed copies.

    `trust_floor` and `decision_policy` are READ from `runtime` rather
    than passed separately because the manifest is the canonical
    source — passing them as parallel arguments would invite drift
    between manifest content and report top-level fields. If a future
    schema bump separates manifest policy from "policy applied to this
    verdict" (e.g., for partial-run resumption), that's a v0.2 change
    with its own projection signature.
