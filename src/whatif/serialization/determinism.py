"""Deterministic-subset extraction — Phase 9A.3.

Reads the committed JSON Schema (`v0.1.schema.json`) to discover
which top-level `ReportV01` fields are tagged `x-deterministic: true`
and projects a serialized report down to that subset. The
deterministic subset is what the determinism CI test compares
byte-for-byte across re-runs of the same fixture; non-deterministic
fields (timestamps, environment fingerprints, sensitive-unwrap
audit logs) live under `runtime` and are excluded.

## Why schema-driven, not a hardcoded list

The `x-deterministic` annotations live on the schema; the schema
is the source of truth (cardinal #4: determinism is opt-in per
field). Hardcoding a list here would drift the moment the schema
adds or removes a tagged field — the extractor must follow the
schema, not the other way around.

## Cardinal #4 alignment

Determinism is opt-in **per field**, not per object. v0.1 ships
top-level scalar/list fields tagged `x-deterministic: true` and
the entire `runtime` subtree tagged `false`. The extractor
operates at the top level only — nested-field determinism (e.g.,
`runtime.config_hash` is deterministic even though `runtime` is
not) is the determinism *claim*, not the comparison surface. The
report's deterministic subset is the part that should be byte-
equal across re-runs; for v0.1 that's everything except `runtime`.
