"""`WhatifJSONEncoder` — artifact-write JSON encoder for `ReportV01`.

Phase 5.3 of the v0.1 implementation plan; pairs with Phase 5.1
(`models_v01.py`) and Phase 5.2 (`projection.py`). The full Phase 5
artifact-write chain:

  internal types
    → `project_to_report_v01(...)` → `ReportV01` (5.2)
    → `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(report)` (5.4, deferred)
    → `WhatifJSONEncoder().encode(report)` (this module)
    → bytes on disk

## What this encoder does

Extends `json.JSONEncoder` with a `default(obj)` override that
handles the project's typed shapes:

- **`Sensitive[T]`** → raises `UnredactedSensitiveError`. This is the
  CARDINAL #5 LAST LINE OF DEFENSE. The graph walk (5.4) is the
  primary defense; this encoder catches anything that slipped past.
  No silent redaction at this layer — the artifact write fails
  loud, never produces a leaked-content report.
- **Frozen dataclasses** → shallow field projection
  (`{f.name: getattr(obj, f.name)}`). Each field's value flows back
  through `default()` via json's recursive walk; nested dataclasses,
  Mappings, and sets resolve through the same dispatch.
  Deliberately NOT `dataclasses.asdict` — that helper deep-copies
  values via `copy.copy`, which chokes on `MappingProxyType` (used
  in `CacheSummary.models_distribution` and `CacheMeta.extra`).
- **`Mapping`** (incl. `MappingProxyType`) → cast to `dict`. The
  forward-compat `extra` field on `CacheMeta` and
  `models_distribution` on `CacheSummary` use these.
- **`tuple` / `frozenset`** → cast to `list`. JSON has no native
  tuple/set; lists preserve order. Sets are sorted to make the
  output deterministic.

## Determinism (cardinal #4)

The `encode_report_v01(report) -> bytes` helper wraps
`WhatifJSONEncoder` with the same canonical kwargs as
`canonical_json_bytes`:

- `sort_keys=True` — deterministic across dict-insertion-order changes.
- `separators=(",", ":")` — no whitespace.
- `ensure_ascii=True` — escape non-ASCII for byte-identical output
  regardless of host locale.

Same input → byte-identical bytes. Phase 5.5 schema-match test runs
the same encode twice on identical input and asserts byte equality.

## Banned-import lint scope

Per `references/enforcement.md` row 2, `json.dumps` is banned
outside `whatif/serialization/`. This module IS in the serialization
package, so the import is sanctioned. Test
`tests/unit/whatif/serialization/test_banned_imports.py` walks
`src/whatif/` AST and asserts zero `json.dumps` calls outside the
serialization package.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 (failures-as-data):** the encoder never silently swallows; an
  un-encodable type raises `TypeError` from stdlib's `default()`
  fallback if `WhatifJSONEncoder.default()` doesn't recognize it.
  Adding new types means extending `default()`, not papering over.
- **#5 (sensitive data wrapped):** `Sensitive[T]` raises rather than
  emits. Three layers per `enforcement.md`:
  - Type-level: mypy strict on `Sensitive[T]` fields.
  - Pre-write graph walk (5.4): `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive`.
  - Encoder default (this module): last line.
- **#6 (typed boundaries):** `encode_report_v01(report: ReportV01) ->
  bytes` takes the typed wire shape. No `dict[str, Any]` boundary.
