"""`assert_no_unredacted_sensitive` — pre-serialization redaction guard.

Phase 5.4 of the v0.1 implementation plan; pairs with Phase 5.1
(types), 5.2 (projection), 5.3 (encoder + banned-import). This is
**layer (b) of the cardinal #5 three-layer defense** per
`references/enforcement.md` row 2:

  (a) `Sensitive[T]` type wrapper enforced via mypy strict.
  (b) Pre-serialization graph walk (THIS MODULE) before any artifact
      write.
  (c) `WhatifJSONEncoder.default()` raises `UnredactedSensitiveError`
      as last line (Phase 5.3).

The graph walk is the PRIMARY runtime defense — it catches every
`Sensitive[T]` reachable from the report's object graph before json
serialization runs. The encoder fallback is the safety net for the
rare case where a graph-walk path was missed.

## Why a recursive walk

A `ReportV01` is a tree of frozen dataclasses, lists, tuples,
mappings, and primitives. Each node may carry a `Sensitive[T]` if
the boundary upstream (adapter ingress, Phase 4) failed to wrap or
unwrap correctly. The walk visits every reachable value:

- `Sensitive[T]` → raise immediately, no further traversal.
- Frozen dataclasses → recurse over `dataclasses.fields(obj)` values.
- Mappings → recurse over keys AND values (a Sensitive in a key is
  as bad as one in a value).
- Lists, tuples, sets, frozensets → recurse over elements.
- Primitives (str, int, float, bool, None, bytes, Path, datetime) →
  no recursion needed; not container-shaped.

A `_seen` set tracks visited dataclass / collection identities to
break reference cycles. The wire shape is acyclic by design (it's a
tree), but the walk is robust to a future cycle without crashing.

## Caller contract

```python
from whatif.serialization import assert_no_unredacted_sensitive

assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(report)  # raises if any Sensitive[T] found
encoded = encode_report_v01(report)     # safe to serialize
write(encoded)
```

The `whatif fork` artifact-write path runs the walk immediately
before `encode_report_v01` so a Sensitive leak fails the write
loudly with a typed error pointing at the problem path.

## What the walk does NOT cover

- `Sensitive[T]` instances stored as attributes on a class that's
  NOT a dataclass and NOT a known container — the walk has no way
  to discover them. v0.1 ReportV01 has no such types; if a v0.2
  introduces one, extending this walk is the right place.
- Module-level globals or class-level attributes on dataclass types
  themselves (only INSTANCE values are walked).
- `Sensitive[T]` masquerading as a non-Sensitive subclass — the
  `isinstance(obj, Sensitive)` check uses runtime type, so a class
  hierarchy that inherits from Sensitive will be detected.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 (failures-as-data):** `UnredactedSensitiveError` is a typed
  exception; callers convert to `FailureRecord` if needed. Not a
  silent log.
- **#5 (sensitive data wrapped):** the load-bearing cardinal-#5
  enforcement at the artifact-write boundary. Combined with
  type-level (a) and encoder fallback (c), the three layers ensure
  no Sensitive[T] leaves the process unredacted.
- **#9 (orchestration not compute):** pure-Python recursion, no
  CPU optimization, no shared-memory tricks. The walk is bounded by
  the report's object graph (small, hundreds of nodes).

    the path to the offending value (e.g.,
