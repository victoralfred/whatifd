"""`Sensitive[T]` redaction wrapper — cardinal rule #5.

Adapters wrap user content (trace inputs, judge rationale, raw scorer
outputs) as `Sensitive[T]` at their boundary. Core's serializer refuses
to write unwrapped sensitive values via three layers of defense:

1. **Type-level (mypy strict)** — adapters return `Sensitive[str]`;
   core types accept `Sensitive[str]` for sensitive fields. mypy catches
   misuse at type-check time. Lives in this module.
2. **Pre-serialization graph walk** — `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(obj)`
   in `whatif/serialization/graph_walk.py` (Phase 5) walks the full
   object graph before any artifact write and raises on any `Sensitive`
   instance. Catches `dataclasses.asdict()` paths that lose type info.
3. **Encoder fallback** — `WhatifJSONEncoder.default()` in
   `whatif/serialization/encoder.py` (Phase 5) raises
   `UnredactedSensitiveError` if a `Sensitive` reaches it. Last line.

The discipline inversion: instead of "audit every serialization path,"
audit becomes "grep for `.unwrap(`." Every unwrap is a reviewable
call site with a logged reason that lands in
`manifest.runtime.sensitive_unwraps`.

Phase 1.2 lands the wrapper, the audit-log record type, the in-process
audit collector, and the two exception types. Phases 5 and 6 wire the
serializer-side defenses; Phase 4 wires the adapter-side wrapping.
