"""Statistical types — Phase 1.7, cardinal rule #10.

The statistical-claims layer of the type model. Cardinal #10 doctrine:
"whatif uses paired trace deltas as the unit of analysis, predeclared
cohort-level endpoints as the basis for verdict, and descriptive (not
inferential) framing for per-trace evidence. Methodology is disclosed
in every report. Scorer caching addresses reproducibility — NOT
reliability, validity, calibration, or absence of bias."

Types in this module fall into three groups:

1. **Trace-delta types** — `TraceDelta` (internal, float arithmetic;
   pairing is structural per CASCADE "Paired-delta as atomic unit") and
   `TraceDeltaReportV01` (public, DecimalString-serialized).

2. **Methodology disclosure types** — five disclosure dataclasses that
   compose into `MethodologyDisclosure`. The composite is a required
   field on `ReportV01` per cardinal #10; schema validation enforces
   presence + content.

3. **Clustering types** — `ClusterKeySupport`, `ClusterSelection`,
   `ClusteringPolicy`. v0.1 declares the cluster-bootstrap structural
   commitment (adapter declares; policy resolves; methodology block
   discloses); the cluster-resampling math is deferred to v0.2 (i.i.d.
   bootstrap with explicit disclosure when no cluster key is available).

Reliability/validity/calibration/bias are EXPLICITLY DISCLOSED-AS-
UNMEASURED via boolean fields on `JudgeMethodDisclosure`. The renderer
shows these in the methodology block — does NOT silently omit them.
v0.1 defaults to `reproducibility_addressed=True` and the other four
False; v0.2/v0.3 add real measurement with opt-in subsets and human-
labeled calibration sets.
