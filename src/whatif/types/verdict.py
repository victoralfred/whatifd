"""Verdict types: `Ship`, `DontShip`, `Inconclusive`, `Verdict` union.

The terminal output of the decision pipeline. One of these three is
constructed per run; the projection layer in `whatif/report/projection.py`
(Phase 5) flattens them into the public `ReportV01.verdict_state`.

Cardinal rule #2 (trust floor cannot be bypassed) is enforced at the
type level by the `proof: FloorPassedProof` field on `Ship`. The
`FloorPassedProof` class lives in `whatif/decision/floor.py` because
the closure-capture pattern that prevents external construction
requires the class and its producer to be in the same module. This
module imports `FloorPassedProof` under `TYPE_CHECKING` only — runtime
types/ has no dependency on decision/.

The trust chain at type level:
1. `evaluate_floor()` is the only function with the closure-captured token.
2. `FloorPassedProof.__init__` validates the token; external construction raises.
3. ∴ `FloorPassedProof` instances exist only when `evaluate_floor()` produced them.
4. `Ship` requires a `FloorPassedProof`.
5. ∴ `Ship` cannot exist without floor passing.

`DontShip` and `Inconclusive` carry `blocking_findings` lists — subsets
of `findings` filtered by severity. `__post_init__` validates the
severity invariant (DontShip: blocks_ship only; Inconclusive: blocks_ship
or blocks_all).
