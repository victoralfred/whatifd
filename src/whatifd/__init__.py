"""whatifd - open experiment runner for LLM behavior changes.

`__version__` is read at import time from the installed
distribution metadata (the `version` field in `pyproject.toml`),
NOT hardcoded here. Single source of truth eliminates the
hardcode-vs-pyproject drift that PR #75's TestPyPI dry-run
caught (where the distribution shipped as `0.1.0rc1` but
`whatifd.__version__` still reported `0.0.1`).

The fallback is a sentinel string for editable / source-only
contexts where `importlib.metadata.version("whatifd")` raises
`PackageNotFoundError` (e.g., a `pytest` invocation against a
checkout that hasn't been `pip install`-ed). Returning a sentinel
rather than re-raising keeps `import whatifd` non-fatal in
development setups.
