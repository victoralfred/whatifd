"""Adapter factory — config name → adapter instance.

Phase 10 CLI wiring foundation. The CLI's `_run_fork_pipeline`
needs to construct a concrete `TraceSource` and `Scorer` from the
adapter names in the validated `WhatifConfig`. This module owns
that dispatch.

## Why a registry, not a switch in cli.py

Three reasons:

1. **Lazy import.** Real adapter packages (`whatifd_langfuse`,
   `whatifd_inspect_ai`) MUST NOT be imported by core code paths
   (cardinal-enforced lazy-load contract pinned by
   `tests/unit/whatifd/adapters/test_protocols.py::
   test_core_modules_do_not_load_real_adapter_packages`). The
   factory imports them inside the dispatch function so `import
   whatifd.cli` doesn't drag them in transitively.
2. **Test isolation.** Wiring tests instantiate the stub adapter
   without spinning up a real Langfuse client. The factory's
   stub branch is the contract surface for that.
3. **Single source of truth.** Adapter name strings appear in the
   user's YAML, the config schema, the cascade catalog, and the
   wiring layer. Centralizing the dispatch here means adding a
   new adapter is one line + one branch + one test, not a
   project-wide grep.

## Why credentials read from the environment, not config

Langfuse credentials are secrets. v0.1's `WhatifConfig` is a
plain YAML/JSON file commonly checked into source control or PR
templates. Reading `LANGFUSE_HOST` / `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` /
`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY` from the environment matches the Langfuse
SDK's own convention and keeps secrets out of repo files. A
follow-up may add a config-block override for non-default hosts,
but the secret material stays in env.

## Failure surface

Construction failures raise `AdapterFactoryError`. The CLI
catches this at the dispatcher and exits with the setup-failure
code (cardinal #1: setup failures are structured signals to the
operator, not stack traces).
