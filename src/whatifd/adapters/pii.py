"""PII-attribute registry and wrapping helper — cardinal #5 boundary
discipline for adapter metadata fields.

`RawTrace.metadata` is a free-form dict the adapter populates from
its source tracer (Langfuse trace.metadata, OpenInference span
attributes, etc.). The contract has always been "input.value and
output.value are wrapped `Sensitive[str]`; everything else passes
through unwrapped because it's *expected* to be tooling state."

That expectation is a comment, not structural enforcement. In
practice, OpenInference and Langfuse both routinely surface
attributes like `user.id`, `session.id`, `user.email`, and arbitrary
custom keys — content that may be PII even though it's not the
canonical input/output pair. The doctrine bot flagged this gap
repeatedly on PR #86 (whatifd-phoenix). Issue #87 tracks the
project-wide fix.

This module ships the fix:

1. **`PII_ATTRIBUTE_KEYS`** — a frozen registry of known-PII
   attribute names spanning OpenInference, Langfuse, and generic
   conventions. Single source of truth across adapters.

2. **`wrap_pii_attributes(metadata)`** — helper that walks an
   adapter-emitted metadata dict and wraps any value at a known-PII
   key as `Sensitive[str]` with the canonical classification
   `"user_content"`. Adapter authors call this once at the
   projection boundary instead of remembering the rule per key.

3. **`format_pii_violation()`** — shared message template used by
   both `wrap_pii_attributes` (raising `PIIAttributeTypeError`) and
   `RawTrace`'s `model_validator` (raising `ValueError` / Pydantic
   `ValidationError`). Centralizing the message text means a future
   registry-shape change (per-key classification, v0.3 custom-key
   registration) updates both surfaces consistently.

4. **Conformance contract** — `tests/adapters/conformance.py`'s
   `test_emitted_traces_wrap_pii_attributes` asserts every emitted
   `RawTrace` whose `metadata` contains a `PII_ATTRIBUTE_KEYS`
   member has `Sensitive[str]` at that key. Adapter implementations
   that forget to call the helper fail the conformance harness on
   first run, not at the serialization boundary downstream.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#5 (sensitive data wrapped, never raw):** the load-bearing
  cardinal. The registry + helper move enforcement from layer (b)
  (graph walk) to layer (a) (type-level + boundary helper). Per
  `references/enforcement.md`'s hierarchy of strength: type-level
  prevention > property test > runtime assertion > convention.
- **#1 (failures-as-data):** `wrap_pii_attributes` raises
  `PIIAttributeTypeError` (typed) if a known-PII key holds a
  non-string non-None value — the adapter cannot silently emit a
  number or list at `user.id`.
- **#6 (public schema hand-written; internal types refactor
  freely):** the registry is hand-curated, not derived from
  external schemas. Adding a new key is a deliberate decision
  recorded in the cascade catalog.

## What's in scope for v0.2

The initial registry covers the conventions surfaced by the two
shipped adapter packages (`whatifd-langfuse`, `whatifd-phoenix`)
plus a small set of cross-vendor common keys. Custom
adapter-specific keys can be added via a future
`register_pii_attribute()` API in v0.3+ — for now the static
frozenset is the canonical surface.

## What's NOT in scope

- `tool_spans` is a separate cardinal-#5 conversation tracked in
  issue #106 + a cascade-catalog entry. Tool I/O is typed
  `list[dict[str, Any]]` for parity with
  `whatifd.contract.ReplayOutput.tool_spans`; tightening it
  requires a coordinated runner-contract change.
- Adapter-supplied custom-attribute registration. The static
  frozenset is intentional v0.2 scope.
- Per-attribute classification beyond `"user_content"`. The
  `Sensitive` wrapper supports richer classifications; the
  wrapping helper uses `"user_content"` uniformly because every
  key in the registry is user-identifying or session-identifying.
