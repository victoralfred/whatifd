"""Adapter protocols + result types.

Phase 4A.1. Two `Protocol`s — `TraceSource` and `Scorer` — and the
small data classes they exchange with core. No implementation.

## Why Protocol, not ABC

Adapter packages are external (`whatifd-langfuse`, `whatifd-inspect-ai`)
and may want to implement the protocol via a callable, a class, or
a module-level shim. `runtime_checkable` Protocol matches the
existing `whatifd.contract.Runner` pattern and gives us `isinstance`
checks at the boundary without forcing inheritance.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 failures-as-data:** the protocols don't raise for typed
  adapter problems — failures surface as `RawTrace.skip_reason` or
  `JudgeResult.score is None`. Genuine boundary errors (network
  outage mid-stream, unparseable response) propagate as exceptions
  that the replay/score pipeline converts into `FailureRecord` /
  `ReplayFailure` per cardinal #1.
- **#5 Sensitive[T] at the boundary:** every text field that
  carries user content (`RawTrace.user_message`,
  `RawTrace.original_response`, `JudgeResult.rationale`) is typed
  `Sensitive[str]`. The conformance harness (Phase 4A.2) and
  graph-walk (`whatifd.serialization.graph_walk`) enforce this at
  test and serialization boundaries.
- **#6 typed boundaries:** result types are Pydantic models with
  `extra="forbid"` so an adapter can't smuggle a free-form dict
  into the report shape.
- **#10 statistical claims:** `TraceSource.cluster_key_support()`
  is mandatory — the methodology disclosure depends on knowing
  whether the adapter can supply cluster keys.
