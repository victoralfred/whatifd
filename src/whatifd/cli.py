"""`whatifd` CLI entry point.

Phase 8.2 of the v0.1 implementation plan. Typer-based command
surface:

  - `whatifd fork [--config PATH] [--profile {default|review|minimal|forensic}]`
    — main entrypoint. Loads config, runs two-affirmation,
    threads `TwoAffirmationProof` to the (Phase 4 / Phase 9)
    adapter pipeline. v0.1 8.2 ships the CLI SHELL — argument
    parsing, config load, two-affirmation, exit-code dispatch.
    The actual fork execution is gated on Phase 4 adapter
    integration; missing adapter → exit 2 with a clear setup
    message, NOT a silent fallback.
  - `whatifd report-migrate <report.json>` — v0.1.x no-op (no
    schema breaks within v0.1.x); real migration logic when v0.2
    ships
  - `whatifd cache rebuild|unlock|verify` — full Phase 8.3 implementations
  - `whatifd diff <prev.json> <new.json>` — full Phase 8.4 diff renderer

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | Ship verdict |
| `1` | Don't Ship verdict |
| `2` | Inconclusive verdict, setup failure, floor violation, OR config error |

Floor violations ALWAYS produce exit 2 regardless of policy
(cardinal #2). Setup failures (missing config, validation
errors, missing forensic affirmation) also produce exit 2
because they prevent producing a verdict at all.

## Two-affirmation invocation point

`assert_two_affirmation` is called IMMEDIATELY after
`load_config` returns and BEFORE any forensic-path code runs.
The returned `TwoAffirmationProof` is threaded to downstream
code that consumes the redaction profile (Phase 8.5+ /
Phase 4 adapter). Cascade-catalog entry "CLI must enforce
two-affirmation before forensic-path code" tracks this.

## Why a thin CLI shell now

The downstream pipeline (replay → score → decision → render)
still has open dependencies on Phase 4 (adapters) and Phase 9
(integration). Shipping the CLI shell now gets the CLI surface,
exit-code semantics, and config-load flow in place; the missing
adapter integration surfaces as a typed exit-2 setup failure,
NOT as a runtime crash that bypasses cardinal #1.

    1. Build the trace source from `cfg.source` (Phase 10.1

    2. Build the scorer from `cfg.scorer` (Phase 10.1 factory).
    3. Load the runner from `cfg.target.runner` (Phase 10.2
       loader).
    4. Build the per-trace `delta_fn` closure threading runner
       + scorer through the replay kernel (Phase 10.3).
    5. Build a `RunManifest` from cfg + runtime info.
    6. Call `run_pipeline(...)` → `ReportV01`.
    7. Run the cardinal-#5 graph walk
       `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive(report)` BEFORE serialization
       (cascade-catalog entry "Artifact-write call-site sequencing
       for graph walk").
    8. Serialize JSON + render Markdown to the configured

    - **#1 failures-as-data:** every adapter / loader exception is
      caught and converted to a setup-failure stderr + exit 2. No
      stack traces leak.
    - **#2 trust floor:** `run_pipeline` enforces the floor; this
      dispatcher does NOT bypass it. The witness-token threading
      lives inside `compute_verdict` — exit 2 surfaces here
      whenever `verdict_state == "inconclusive"`.
    - **#5 Sensitive at boundary:** `assert_no_unredacted_sensitive`
      runs BEFORE `encode_report_v01` so an unwrapped Sensitive
      anywhere in the report tree fails loud at the graph walk
      (the structural defense), not silently at the encoder fallback.
