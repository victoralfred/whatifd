"""Per-trace `delta_fn` closure threading runner + scorer.

Phase 10.3 of the v0.1 implementation plan. The CLI's
`_run_fork_pipeline` (Phase 10.4) needs a `Callable[[RawTrace],
float]` to hand to `whatifd.pipeline.run_pipeline`. That closure
must:

1. Run the user-supplied runner against the trace input — sync
   via `whatifd.replay.kernel.replay_one_trace`, async via
   `whatifd.replay.kernel_async.replay_one_trace_async`. The
   `LoadedRunner.kind` from Phase 10.2 picks the kernel.
2. Project the resulting `ReplayOutput` into a `ScoreCase` along
   with the original trace artifacts.
3. Call `Scorer.score(case)` and return `JudgeResult.score`.

## Failure mapping (cardinal #1)

The closure is consumed by `run_pipeline`, which catches every
exception from `delta_fn` and constructs a `scorer_unavailable`
`FailureRecord`. The closure leverages this contract:

- A `ReplayFailure` from the kernel raises a typed
  `_ReplayStageError` with the kernel's code in the message;
  the pipeline's exception path captures it. The replay code
  ends up in the `FailureRecord.details["replay_code"]` slot —
  not as expressive as projecting `ReplayFailure` directly, but
  consistent with v0.1's `delta_fn`-shape pipeline.
- A `JudgeResult.score == None` (cardinal-#1 structural scorer
  failure) raises `_ScorerStructuralError` with the rationale
  in the message. Same pipeline path.

Phase 10.4+ may widen the pipeline to consume `ReplayResult`
directly so replay failures get their own typed
`FailureRecord` projection. v0.1's surface is this closure;
the upgrade path doesn't change its signature.

## Why a module, not a method

The closure carries state — the runner, the scorer, the change
config, the timeout — but it must be a plain function callable to
fit `run_pipeline`'s `delta_fn` parameter shape. A factory
function (`build_delta_fn(...)`) returning a closure keeps the
state-binding explicit and testable in isolation, separate from
the CLI dispatcher in Phase 10.4.
