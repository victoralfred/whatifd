"""Failure code registry — Phase 2.2, cardinal rule #1.

Cardinal rule #1 (failure-as-data) says every expected failure surfaces as
a structured `FailureRecord` in the report. The registry is the source of
truth for "what counts as an expected failure":

- Each entry pairs a code with its `stage`, `default_scope`, the required
  `details` keys (so the projection layer in Phase 5 can validate that
  every emitted record carries enough context to be actionable), a default
  `retryable` value, and a human-readable description.
- The registry is frozen at module import (`MappingProxyType`); no code
  path mutates it after definition.

`make_failure_record` is the canonical factory. It pulls defaults from the
registry and validates programmer-contract invariants (unknown code,
missing required details, scope/trace_id/cohort mismatch). These are
programmer errors, not runtime data failures — `ValueError` is the right
shape per the cardinal #1 doctrine ("expected failures are data;
contract violations are bugs in whatif itself").

Phase 9 integration tests (per phases.md) inject every code in this
registry and verify each produces a structured `FailureRecord`, never an
unhandled exception. New codes added in v0.2+ go here; the test sweep
catches any code lacking a fix-suggestion entry (Phase 2.4).

    """One row in `FAILURE_CODE_REGISTRY`.

    `stage` is sealed by the `Stage` literal (ingest/selection/replay/
    score/diff/decision/report). `default_scope` is the scope the factory
    uses when the caller does not override it; aggregation in Phase 2.7
    may emit a cohort-scope record for a code whose default is trace.

    `required_details` is the tuple of keys that MUST be present in the
    `FailureRecord.details` mapping. The factory raises if any are
    missing. Order is stable (tuple, not set) because schema rendering in
    Phase 7 lists the keys in declaration order.

    `description` is internal-only — adopters read this in code review
    when adding a new code. Renderer text comes from the fix-suggestion
    registry (Phase 2.4), not here.
