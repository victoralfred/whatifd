"""Floor evaluator and `FloorPassedProof` witness token (cardinal rule #2).

The trust floor is structural — it cannot be bypassed by configuration.
This module implements the type-level enforcement: `Ship` requires a
`FloorPassedProof`, and the only function that can produce one is
`evaluate_floor()`. Any code path that constructs a Ship is forced to
go through floor evaluation.

## The closure-capture pattern (CASCADE-010, v0.1 resolution)

The original deliberation considered three approaches to enforcing
"only `evaluate_floor` can produce valid proofs":

1. **Underscore-token convention** — `_FLOOR_INTERNAL_TOKEN = object()`
   at module level; constructor compares against it. Bypassable by
   `from whatifd.decision.floor import _FLOOR_INTERNAL_TOKEN` (single-
   underscore is private by convention only). Rejected: convention,
   not structural.

2. **Closure-capture** (this implementation) — the token lives in the
   closure of `_build_floor_machinery()`. After that function returns,
   the local `_floor_token` is unreachable through any module-level
   name. The class `FloorPassedProof` and the function `evaluate_floor`
   both close over the token; they're returned to module scope, but
   the token itself is not. Adversarial code that imports this module
   thoroughly cannot find a name that resolves to the token.

3. **Verify-on-construction** — `Ship.__post_init__` re-runs floor logic
   to verify the proof matches its cohort results. Closes cross-run
   proof reuse but adds runtime cost. Deferred to v1.0; CASCADE-205.

This module ships option 2. CASCADE-010 is resolved-for-v0.1 by this
file. The v1.0 hardening (cohort-hash binding) is a separate cascade.

## Known v0.1 limit

Closure-capture is bypassable by Python introspection:
`FloorPassedProof.__init__.__closure__[N].cell_contents` extracts the
captured token. Any contributor running that as production code is
visibly doing something adversarial — code review catches it. The
property test "no DecisionPolicy configuration produces Ship when
evaluate_floor returns FloorFailureSet" (Phase 2 gate) covers
configuration-coverage gaps. Together: structural enforcement against
accidental bypass; visible enforcement against deliberate bypass;
property test against policy-coverage gaps.

## Layering and mypy reconciliation

`FloorPassedProof` lives here, not in `whatif/types/verdict.py`,
because closure-capture requires the class and its producer to be in
the same module. `Ship` (in `types/verdict.py`) imports `FloorPassedProof`
under `TYPE_CHECKING` so the runtime types/ layer carries no
dependency on decision/.

mypy can't analyze classes built inside closures as named types. To
satisfy strict typing, this module declares `FloorPassedProof` and
`FloorFailureSet` as `TYPE_CHECKING`-only stubs at module top — mypy
sees those stubs as the public type. At runtime, the same names are
rebound to the closure-built classes (with `# type: ignore[no-redef]`
on the rebind). Static analysis and runtime see consistent surface;
the closure-capture protection is preserved at runtime.

        Per cardinal rule #2, the floor is structural: failing any rule
        for any required cohort yields a `FloorFailureSet` (the run is
        Inconclusive); passing all rules yields a `FloorPassedProof`
        (the only object that allows `Ship` construction).

        Per-cohort rule failures are computed from each cohort's raw
        counts (`selected`, `replayed`, `scored`) by
        `compute_cohort_floor_failures`. Aggregation across required
        cohorts happens here.

        A required cohort that's absent from `cohort_results` is itself a
        `blocks_all` floor failure with rule `"required_cohort_present"`
        — distinct from the per-cohort numeric rules so the renderer can
        surface the missing-cohort case directly.

        An empty `required_cohorts` is itself a structural failure under
        cardinal #2 — it would otherwise produce a vacuous proof
        (no rules to fail) and let `Ship` construct on a misconfigured
        policy. We emit `required_cohorts_nonempty` (severity `blocks_all`)
        so the floor refuses to issue a proof for a policy with nothing
        to require. Per cardinal #1 this is a structured failure, not an
        exception — the verdict layer turns it into Inconclusive with an
        actionable message.

        `now` is injectable for deterministic tests; defaults to UTC wall
        clock. The proof's `evaluated_at` is the ISO 8601 string at the
