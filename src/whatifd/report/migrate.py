"""Report migration — v0.1 → v0.2.

Phase A of the v0.2 roadmap. The v0.1 schema bump introduced a single
required top-level field on `ReportV01`: `experiment_shape`. v0.1
reports are upgraded by injecting `experiment_shape: "failure_rescue"`
(the only shape v0.1 supported) and bumping `schema_version` + `schema_uri`.

## Doctrine

- **Cardinal #1 (failure-as-data):** malformed input → typed
  `MigrationError`, never an unhandled exception. The CLI catches
  the typed error and emits a structured stderr message.
- **Cardinal #6 (public schema hand-written):** the migrator works on
  raw dict[str, Any] (the wire shape) — it does NOT instantiate
  `ReportV01` from the v0.1 input, because the v0.1 dict lacks the
  v0.2-required `experiment_shape` field. Construction of the typed
  `ReportV01` would fail before the migration could inject it. Working
  on the dict keeps the migration boundary clean.
- **Idempotence:** a v0.2 report passed through the migrator is
  returned unchanged with `changed=False`.

## Future migrations

When v0.3 schema lands, extend `_MIGRATIONS` with `"0.2" -> _migrate_v0_2_to_v0_3`.
The dispatcher walks the chain: v0.1 → v0.2 → v0.3 → ... → current.
