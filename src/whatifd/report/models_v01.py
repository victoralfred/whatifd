"""`ReportV01` — the v0.1 public report schema.

Hand-written per cardinal #6: public schema is hand-written; internal
types refactor freely. This module is the wire-format contract for
the `whatifd fork` output. The shape committed here is what
`schemas/report/v0.1.schema.json` will derive from in a later sub-
phase, and what consumer tooling (dashboards, alerting, schema-
validation in third-party tools) will read.

## What lives here vs. `whatifd/types/`

`whatifd/types/` carries INTERNAL types — the concrete dataclasses the
decision pipeline operates on (Verdict sealed union, FloorPassedProof
witness token, internal Sensitive[T] wrappers, etc.). These can change
between minor versions; the only consumers are in-tree.

`whatifd/report/models_v01.py` (this module) carries PUBLIC types —
the wire shape consumed by external tooling. These cannot change
without a schema-version bump (`v0.1` → `v0.2`). Per
`references/contracts.md` §"Schema versioning":

- Adding a NEW field with a default → patch (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`).
- Renaming/removing a field, tightening a type, changing semantics
  of an existing field → minor (`0.1` → `0.2`) with a
  `whatifd report-migrate` migration stub.
- Removing a verdict state, breaking the schema-validation contract
  → major (`v0.1` → `v1.0`).

The `projection.py` module (later sub-phase) translates internal
types → ReportV01 for serialization. Internal Verdict (sealed union)
becomes wire `verdict_state: Literal[...]` plus flattened
`cohort_results` / `decision_findings` siblings — the wire format
favors flat schema-friendly shapes over algebraic types.

## Cardinal alignment

- **#1 (failures-as-data):** `failures: list[FailureRecord]` is a
  required field; an empty list is valid (clean run), `None` is not.
  Schema validation enforces presence.
- **#2 (floor cannot be bypassed):** `verdict_state` is a closed
  literal; a `Ship` value cannot be constructed in `projection.py`
  without a `FloorPassedProof` (the witness token is consumed by the
  internal `Verdict` type before projection runs).
- **#4 (determinism opt-in):** the schema generation step (later
  sub-phase) annotates each field with `x-deterministic: true|false`.
  `runtime` is annotated `false`; everything else defaults to `true`.
- **#5 (sensitive data wrapped):** `ReportV01` itself never holds
  `Sensitive[T]` — by the time projection runs, all sensitive content
  has been redacted by the artifact-bundle profile (Phase 8) or
  unwrapped via audited `.unwrap(reason=...)` calls. The pre-
  serialization graph walk (`assert_no_unredacted_sensitive`, later
  sub-phase) is the structural defense.
- **#6 (public schema hand-written):** every field below is
  hand-written. No `dict[str, Any]` crosses this boundary; nested
  shapes are typed dataclasses.
- **#10 (statistical claims match design):** `methodology:
  MethodologyDisclosure` is a REQUIRED field. The renderer-test in
  Phase 7 asserts the methodology block appears in every full-form
  rendered report.

## Schema constants

`REPORT_SCHEMA_VERSION = "0.1"` and `REPORT_SCHEMA_URI =
"https://whatif.codes/schema/report/v0.1.json"` are stamped into
every `ReportV01` instance. Bumping these requires:

1. Migrating in-tree consumer code (renderer, projection).
2. Authoring a `whatifd report-migrate` stub for v0.1 → v0.2.
3. Republishing the schema URI.
4. Updating `references/contracts.md` § "Schema versioning" with the
   change record.

The constants are deliberately exported at the package level so
projection code references them without re-deriving.

VerdictState = Literal["ship", "dont_ship", "inconclusive"]
"""Wire-format verdict literal. The internal `Verdict` sealed union
(`Ship | DontShip | Inconclusive`) projects to one of these three
strings; the witness-token machinery (cardinal #2) operates on the
internal union, not on the wire format. JSON schema can express
literal strings but not Python sealed unions, so the wire shape
flattens.

## Cardinal #2 contract for projection.py implementers

When `whatifd/report/projection.py` lands (Phase 5.2), the
`project_to_report_v01(...)` function MUST take an internal `Verdict`
(union of `Ship | DontShip | Inconclusive`) as input — not a bare
`VerdictState` string and not the components of a Ship. The reason is
structural: the only way to get a `Ship` instance is to have called
`evaluate_floor()` and consumed its `FloorPassedProof` token. By
making projection accept `Verdict` rather than `verdict_state: str`,
the caller is forced through that witness-token path. A `Verdict`
input → `verdict_state="ship"` output mapping is then trivially
sound. Any other shape (e.g., `project_to_report_v01(verdict_state:
str, ...)`) re-opens the cardinal #2 bypass that the witness pattern
exists to close.
