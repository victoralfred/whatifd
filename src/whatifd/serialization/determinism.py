"""Deterministic-subset extraction — Phase 9A.3.

Reads the committed JSON Schema (`v0.1.schema.json`) to discover
which top-level `ReportV01` fields are tagged `x-deterministic: true`
and projects a serialized report down to that subset. The
deterministic subset is what the determinism CI test compares
byte-for-byte across re-runs of the same fixture; non-deterministic
fields (timestamps, environment fingerprints, sensitive-unwrap
audit logs) live under `runtime` and are excluded.

## Why schema-driven, not a hardcoded list

The `x-deterministic` annotations live on the schema; the schema
is the source of truth (cardinal #4: determinism is opt-in per
field). Hardcoding a list here would drift the moment the schema
adds or removes a tagged field — the extractor must follow the
schema, not the other way around.

## Cardinal #4 alignment

Determinism is opt-in **per field**, not per object. v0.1 ships
top-level scalar/list fields tagged `x-deterministic: true` and
the entire `runtime` subtree tagged `false`. The extractor
operates at the top level only — nested-field determinism (e.g.,
`runtime.config_hash` is deterministic even though `runtime` is
not) is the determinism *claim*, not the comparison surface. The
report's deterministic subset is the part that should be byte-
equal across re-runs; for v0.1 that's everything except `runtime`.

# hyphen and isn't a valid Python identifier. `total=False` because
# the schema's per-property keys are optional — a property may
# carry `type` OR `$ref`, `x-deterministic` may be absent on legacy
# fields, etc. The extractor uses `.get("x-deterministic")` so
# absence is safe; the typed shape exists so callers don't see
# `dict[str, Any]` bleed across the internal/boundary line.
# Self-recursive: a schema property's `items` is itself a property
# (the element schema for an array), and `properties` maps names to
# nested property definitions. Forward-referencing via the string
# `"SchemaProperty"` closes the loop. `additionalProperties` accepts
# either a bool (true/false) or another SchemaProperty per JSON
# Schema. The recursive shape eliminates the `dict[str, Any]` surface
# the prior version carried; only the JSON-loaded value type from
# `json.loads` (which is fundamentally `Any`) remains, and that's
# bounded to the `_schema_properties` cast.
# `Union[bool, "SchemaProperty"]` rather than `"bool | SchemaProperty"`:
# the project's minimum supported Python is 3.11 (where `bool | X`

# its second argument at module-load time. The string-form pipe
# union `"bool | SchemaProperty"` is a forward reference under
# `from __future__ import annotations`, but TypedDict's runtime
# resolution path historically had subtle interactions with pipe
# unions in string form. `Union[bool, "SchemaProperty"]` works
# uniformly across mypy and runtime introspection on every

    round-trip through `encode_report_v01` → `json.loads` →

    available for tests that explicitly want to exercise the

    `extract_deterministic_subset(json.loads(encode_report_v01(report)))`.
    Tests that don't want to exercise the serialization seam can
    swap freely between the two surfaces. The equivalence is pinned
    by `test_extract_from_report_matches_round_trip` in
    `tests/integration/test_determinism.py`; that test is the

    typed helper short-circuits the encoder) MUST update both this
    docstring and that test in the same PR.

    encoder module into `whatifd.serialization.determinism`'s import
    graph at package load — keeps the determinism module light for

    `encode_report_v01` → `json.loads` → `extract_deterministic_subset`.
    For one-shot extraction (CI diff gate, single comparison) the

    extraction over many reports (a hypothetical batch determinism
    audit) — call `encode_report_v01(report)` once, parse to a dict
    once, then call `extract_deterministic_subset(dict_)` many
    times against in-memory variants. The round-trip dominates the
    extraction cost; doing it once amortizes over the batch.
