"""Paired-percentile bootstrap — Phase E.1 of the v0.2 plan.

Doctrinally-correct replacement for the v0.1 empirical-percentile
shortcut in `whatifd.pipeline`. Resamples the per-trace delta
sequence with replacement N times, computes the bootstrap
distribution of the median, and returns the empirical 5th/95th
percentile of that distribution as the CI bounds.

## Why paired bootstrap, not stratified

Cardinal #10's unit of analysis is the **paired trace delta**: each
trace produces an `(original, replayed)` pair, and the per-trace
delta is the analytic atom. Bootstrap resampling at the
paired-trace level (rather than at the original-or-replayed-only
level) preserves that pairing — every resample draws whole pairs,
not orphaned originals or orphaned replays.

For v0.2 the resampling is i.i.d. across paired traces; cluster-
paired bootstrap (where resamples respect cluster boundaries like
session_id) is the v0.3 surface. The schema enum already
distinguishes `paired_percentile_bootstrap` from
`cluster_paired_percentile_bootstrap` so this module's output is
forward-compatible with the cluster variant.

## Determinism

`seed` is required (no default) so a future caller can't accidentally
ship a non-reproducible CI. The method seeds a fresh
`random.Random` instance — NOT the global `random` module — so
concurrent runs in the same process don't interleave.

## Why not numpy

Cardinal #9 (orchestration, not compute). The bootstrap is N
typically in [1000, 10000] and pure Python `random.choices` is
adequate for floor-passing verdicts. The v0.2 cascade catalog
notes a vectorized-numpy variant as a v0.3 optimization gated on
profile data showing this is a real bottleneck; the schema enum
stays unchanged either way.

    `deltas` is the sequence of per-trace deltas (one float per
    paired trace). `resamples` is the number of bootstrap iterations
    (default 2000 — adequate for floor-passing 95% CIs at the trace
    counts cardinal #2 requires). `ci_level` is the confidence
    level as a fraction in (0, 1).

    Raises `ValueError` on:
    - empty `deltas` (caller must filter; bootstrap on zero samples
      is undefined),
    - `resamples < 1`,
    - `ci_level not in (0, 1)`.

    Cardinal #1: structural input errors raise typed `ValueError`,
    not silent zeros. The pipeline layer catches and surfaces these
    as structured `ReplayFailure` if they originate from per-trace
    data; for direct callers, the exception is the right shape.

    ## Why `seed` is required but `resamples` defaults

    `seed` carries reproducibility — without it, the same input
    produces a different CI each call, which silently breaks
    cardinal #4 (determinism opt-in per field). Forcing the caller
    to pass it makes the choice explicit; `seed=0` is a legitimate
    "I don't care" answer, but it's an answer, not an omission.

    `resamples` carries statistical power, not correctness. 2000 is
    the convergent default in the bootstrap literature for 95%
    percentile CIs at sample sizes in the cardinal-#2 floor range
    (n in [10, 200]); a caller who passes a different value usually
    has a calibration reason, and the default is safe when they
    don't. Forcing the caller to pass `resamples` would be ceremony
    without doctrinal payoff.

    `ci_level` follows the same logic — 0.95 is the convergent
    confidence level for the report's primary CI surface; opting
    out is a legitimate calibration choice but the default is safe.
