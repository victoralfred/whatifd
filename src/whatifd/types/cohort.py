"""`FloorFailure` and `CohortResult` — per-cohort artifacts.

Cardinal rule #2 doctrine: the trust floor is about evidence existence,
not evidence quality. Below the floor, no verdict can be rendered (the
run is `Inconclusive`); above the floor, evidence exists but its quality
is a policy concern.

`CohortResult` is the per-cohort artifact carrying both the raw counts
(selected/replayed/scored) and the floor evaluation outcome. One of these
is produced per required cohort during `evaluate_floor()` (Phase 2).

`FloorFailure` is the structured record of a single floor-rule violation.
Replaces an earlier prose-only "list of failed rules" with a typed shape
so renderers and downstream consumers don't have to re-parse strings.

class CohortResult:
    """Per-cohort stats + floor evaluation outcome.

    The unit of statistical inference per cardinal rule #10 — verdicts
    derive from per-cohort primary endpoints, not per-trace observations.

    Per V0_1_DECISION_RECORD §2 the CI status is split into two fields:

    - `ci_computable` (structural): whether bootstrap CI was computed
      successfully. False when the bootstrap couldn't run (sample too
      small, zero variance, computation failed). When False,
      `ci_unavailable_reason` carries the structured reason. When
      True, `ci_unavailable_reason` is None. `ci_availability_guard`
      reads this and emits `blocks_all` for required cohorts.
    - `ci_meaningful` (policy quality): whether the computed CI is
      narrow enough to be actionable (width below
      `policy.max_ci_width`). Defaults to True for v0.1; the
      width-vs-threshold check is wired in a later phase (cache
      subsystem + stats layer). False is only valid when
      `ci_computable=True`. See cascade-catalog
      "ci_meaningful policy-guard wiring".

    The split keeps cardinal #2 honest: structural failures
    (`ci_computable=False`) and policy-quality concerns
    (`ci_meaningful=False`) live at different layers with different
    severities. Conflating them into a single `ci_available` was the
    v0.1 doctrine drift the skill-alignment pass corrects.

    Numeric fields in the determinism budget (`median_delta`, `ci_lower`,
    `ci_upper`) are typed `DecimalString` per cardinal rule #4. Float
    arithmetic happens internally; emission via `format(value, '.3f')`
    in `whatif/serialization/decimal.py` (Phase 5) is platform-stable.

    `floor_passed` is True iff `floor_failures` is empty.

    `improved_count`, `unchanged_count`, `regressed_count` carry the
    per-cohort outcome partition over scored traces (per cardinal #10
    paired-delta unit of analysis): a trace is `improved` when its
    paired delta exceeds `policy.practical_delta_epsilon`, `regressed`
    when it falls below `-epsilon`, and `unchanged` otherwise. The
    rate-based guards (`baseline_regression_guard`,
    `failure_improvement_guard`) read these counts to compute
    regression/improvement rates against the policy thresholds. The
    counts default to 0 so pre-Phase-2.5b construction sites
    (test fixtures, the floor evaluator) continue to work without
    rate data; guards check `total > 0` before computing rates.
