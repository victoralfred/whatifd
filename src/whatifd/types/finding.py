"""`DecisionFinding` — policy conclusion, one per conclusion.

The two-type rule's other half (see `whatif/types/failure.py`):
- `FailureRecord` is what happened (operational fact, layer-pure).
- `DecisionFinding` is what it means (policy conclusion, may reference
  failures).

A finding may or may not derive from `FailureRecord`s. Aggregate baseline
regression has no underlying operational failure (every trace replayed,
scored, the cache worked — the baseline just regressed). Cache-miss-driven
floor failure has many.

Severity vocabulary is shared across the codebase (no separate enum for
failures vs findings):
- `info` — informational only; no verdict impact.
- `degrades_trust` — accumulates against thresholds; may downgrade verdict.
- `blocks_ship` — prevents Ship verdict; produces Don't Ship.
- `blocks_all` — forces Inconclusive regardless of policy state.
