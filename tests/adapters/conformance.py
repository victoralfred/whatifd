"""Adapter conformance harness — Phase 4A.2.

Parameterized base classes that any concrete `TraceSource` /
`Scorer` adapter must subclass and pass. Single source of truth for
"what makes an adapter valid"; runs against the synthetic stub at
Phase 4A.3 and against `whatif-langfuse` / `whatif-inspect-ai` at
Phase 4B.

## How to use this harness

Each adapter package writes a small `test_<name>_conformance.py`
under `tests/adapters/` (or in its own package) that subclasses
`TraceSourceConformance` and/or `ScorerConformance`, overrides the
`trace_source` / `scorer` fixture(s) to construct the adapter under
test, and runs:

```python
import pytest
from tests.adapters.conformance import TraceSourceConformance

class TestStubTraceSource(TraceSourceConformance):
    @pytest.fixture
    def trace_source(self) -> TraceSource:
        return MyStubTraceSource(...)
```

Pytest discovers the subclass, finds the inherited `test_*` methods,
and runs them with the overridden fixture. Add a new conformance
property by adding a `test_*` method to the appropriate base class
here — every concrete subclass inherits it for free.

## Why a base-class pattern (not pytest_generate_tests)

`pytest_generate_tests` parametrizes by value; the harness needs to
parametrize by **adapter implementation**, which is a class-level
discriminator. Subclassing matches that shape without per-test
boilerplate. The cost — `__test__ = False` on the base classes so
pytest doesn't try to run them with the unimplemented fixture — is
a one-line discipline rule documented at each base.

## What this harness does NOT cover

- Adapter-specific behavior (Langfuse-shape projection, Inspect AI
  rubric encoding). Those belong in adapter-package internal tests.
- Performance budgets. Phase 9A's pipeline timing test owns that.
- End-to-end CLI integration. Phase 9 owns that.
