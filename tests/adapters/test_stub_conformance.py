"""Run the conformance harness against the synthetic stub adapter.

Phase 4A.3. Closes the cascade-catalog Phase 4A.2 conformance-
harness checklist item that says "harness runs against the
synthetic stub at 4A.3 and is green."

This file is the inverse of `test_conformance_self_test.py`:
- Self-test uses minimum-viable in-file fakes to prove the harness
  machinery is correct (4A.2's own coverage).
- This file uses the actual `whatifd.adapters.stub` module to prove
  the stub itself satisfies every conformance property.

Phase 4B will add `test_langfuse_conformance.py` and
`test_inspect_ai_conformance.py` following the same pattern.
