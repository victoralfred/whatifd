"""Phase 9A.3 integration test — determinism byte-equality.

Cardinal #4: determinism is opt-in per field. The deterministic
subset of a `ReportV01` (every top-level field tagged
`x-deterministic: true` in the schema — currently everything
except `runtime`) MUST be byte-equal across re-runs of the same
fixture. This test runs all four of the Phase 9A scenarios twice
each, extracts the deterministic subset from both runs, and pins
byte-equality.

If a future change introduces non-determinism into a tagged field
(e.g., a guard that emits findings in iteration order without
sorting), this test fails first. The fix is either to make the
field deterministic OR to flip its `x-deterministic` annotation —
NEVER to relax this test's byte-equality assertion.

## Schema-coverage cross-check

`test_schema_deterministic_field_set_matches_extractor` asserts
the extractor's view of the deterministic field set matches the
top-level schema annotations. A future schema change that adds a
deterministic field MUST surface here; otherwise the
byte-equality assertion above silently stops covering the new
field.
