"""Phase I integration tests — `whatifd-fork` composite GitHub Action.

The action is a thin shell-script wrapper; the tested surface is:

1. The `action.yml` is structurally valid YAML and declares the
   inputs/outputs/runs sections the README documents.
2. The exit-code → verdict mapping covers the CLI's three outcomes.
3. The PR-comment guard fires only on `pull_request` events.
4. The `fail-on-dont-ship` guard fires only when exit_code != '0'.

We don't run the action end-to-end here — that requires a real GitHub
runner. The structural pins catch the most common refactor regressions
(missing input/output, broken guard expression) without that infra.
