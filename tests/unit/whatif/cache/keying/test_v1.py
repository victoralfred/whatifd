"""Tests for `whatif.cache.keying.v1` — Phase 3.1 cache key construction.

The load-bearing properties:

1. **Determinism** — same components produce the same key, on every
   platform, every interpreter, every run. The test pins this against
   a known-input known-output pair so a future implementation change
   that broke determinism (e.g., switching to a non-canonical encoder)
   would fail loudly with a diff against the recorded digest.

2. **Sensitivity to every component** — changing any field changes the
   key. The parametrized test mutates each field in turn and asserts
   the key changes. A future "optimization" that dropped a field from
   the hash would surface here as a "key didn't change" failure.

3. **Version prefix** — the `v1:` prefix is part of the key contract.
   Storage code uses it to split entries across versions. Tests pin
   the prefix so a rename to `v01:` or similar drift fails.
