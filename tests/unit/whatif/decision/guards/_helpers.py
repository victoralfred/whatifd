"""Shared helpers for `tests/unit/whatif/decision/guards/`.

Consolidates the `_failure_cohort` builder that previously lived in
three separate test files. When `CohortResult` is extended with
rate-count fields (per cascade-catalog "Phase 2.5 deferred guards"),
this helper is the single update site instead of three.

Underscore-prefixed filename keeps pytest from collecting it as a
test module.
