"""Structural test enforcing the guards-emit-via-factory discipline.

The package docstring at `whatif.decision.guards.__init__` says:
"A guard only ever emits findings via `make_decision_finding`, never
via `DecisionFinding(...)` directly — the registry-level severity is
load-bearing per cardinal #2."

This test makes the discipline structural rather than doc-only by
scanning every guard module's source and asserting it contains no
direct `DecisionFinding(...)` constructor call. Type annotations like
`list[DecisionFinding]` are fine — those don't use parens after the
name.

If a future contributor genuinely needs to construct a `DecisionFinding`
without the registry (the contract-violation path is the only legit
one I can think of, and it shouldn't live in a guard), they need to
update this test with a justified `# allow-direct-construction`
exemption — which a reviewer will catch.
