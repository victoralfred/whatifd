"""Cardinal #10 layer composition test — Phase 2.5b/2.6b integration.

Pins the end-to-end behavior of the cardinal-#10 guards running
together via `run_guards`:

- `primary_endpoint_guard` (configurable rate-based endpoints, load-bearing)
- `practical_delta_guard` (supplementary magnitude layer)

Per cardinal #10, these guards form the verdict's statistical-claims
layer for v0.1. They MUST compose cleanly: each reads only its own
cohort's data, run_guards concatenates findings in registration order,
and the verdict layer (Phase 2.6) selects Ship/DontShip/Inconclusive
from the resulting findings.

Phase 2.6b consolidation: `primary_endpoint_guard` replaced the
previous (`failure_improvement_guard`, `baseline_regression_guard`)
hardcoded pair. For the default policy, `primary_endpoint_guard`
emits findings under the same codes the pair did — but it can also
read custom `policy.primary_endpoints`.

This test does NOT call the verdict layer (that's Phase 2.6); it
asserts the pre-verdict guard composition is correct on realistic
cohort scenarios.
