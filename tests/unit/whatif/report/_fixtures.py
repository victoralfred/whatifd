"""Shared fixture builders for `tests/unit/whatif/report/`.

`test_models_v01.py` (Phase 5.1) and `test_projection.py` (Phase 5.2)
both need fully-typed instances of the dependent sub-shapes
(`CohortResult`, `CacheSummary`, `MethodologyDisclosure`, `RunManifest`,
etc.) AND realistic `Verdict` instances. Centralizing the builders
here:

- Avoids drift between the two test files' fixture shapes.
- Gives a single place to update when a sub-shape adds a required
  field (one builder edit, not N).
- Keeps individual test files focused on the assertion they're
  pinning, not on the construction boilerplate.
- Centralizes the witness-token path (`ship()` routes through
  `evaluate_floor` to obtain a real `FloorPassedProof`) so future
  test files don't re-implement verdict construction and risk
  diverging from the canonical cardinal #2 path.

Each builder is a no-arg factory returning a known-good instance,
matching the pattern Phase 3.x test files used internally
(`_components()` in `test_v1.py`, `_summary()` in `test_summary.py`).
