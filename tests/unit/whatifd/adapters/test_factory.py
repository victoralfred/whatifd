"""Phase 10 CLI wiring foundation — adapter factory tests.

## Optional-adapter skip discipline

Tests that touch `whatifd_inspect_ai` (the v0.2 inspect_ai factory
path) gate on `pytest.importorskip("whatifd_inspect_ai")` — including
the parametrized belt-and-suspenders test
`test_build_scorer_inspect_ai_belt_and_suspenders_judge_fields`. CI
matrices that don't install the optional adapter package will skip
those rows; the lazy-import contract is preserved at the test
boundary. Coverage of the inspect_ai-specific branches is therefore
conditional on the adapter being installed in the test environment.
