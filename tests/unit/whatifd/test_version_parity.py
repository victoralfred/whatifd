"""Version-parity guard: `__version__` must come from distribution metadata.

Regression test for the `0.0.1` vs `0.1.0rc1` drift caught during the
TestPyPI dry-run (see PR #76). A hardcoded `__version__` literal in
`__init__.py` silently desyncs from the `pyproject.toml` `version` field
because `uv build` reads pyproject but `import whatifd` reads the
literal — and PyPI version slots cannot be republished, so a release
tagged with the drift would ship the wrong `__version__` forever.

The fix is to read the version from `importlib.metadata.version(<dist>)`
at import time. This test pins that approach: when the package is
installed (which it is in any test run that uses `uv sync`),
`pkg.__version__` MUST equal `importlib.metadata.version(<dist-name>)`.

It additionally pins **cross-package version parity** — all three
distributions in the workspace release together (see `release.yml`),
so a sub-package whose `pyproject.toml` `version` drifts out of lockstep
is a release-correctness bug that this gate catches at PR time.

    the metadata tests as confusing failures with no obvious root
    cause. This fixture probes `importlib.metadata` once per module and
    fails the whole module with an actionable message if any package is
    missing.

    Module-scope autouse rather than a `conftest.py` so the guard is
    co-located with the tests it protects — `conftest.py` would broaden
    the precondition to every test under this directory, which isn't
    the intent. `pytest.importorskip` is deliberately NOT used; skipping
    would let CI go green on a broken install.

    Control flow: the precondition runs BEFORE `yield`. On failure,
    `pytest.fail(...)` raises and the fixture never yields — pytest
    handles that as a setup error and skips teardown, which is exactly
    what we want (no setup happened, nothing to tear down). On success
    the unconditional `yield` runs and there's no teardown body, so
